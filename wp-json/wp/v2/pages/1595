The importer of record is responsible for filing all entry documents with the authorities at the port of entry. When exporting from Canada to the U.S., the importer of record can be the exporter (you), your consignee\/buyer, or your U.S. customs broker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to defer payment of duties and processing fees until you have completed the sale of your goods, you can have them sent to a bonded warehouse. Duties and fees are not levied until the goods leave the warehouse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the goods have arrived at the port of entry, they will be examined by U.S. Customs officials to determine:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the value of the goods for customs and duty purposes;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the validity of the marking and labeling;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the validity of the invoice;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether the shipment contains any prohibited goods; and<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether the requirements of other U.S. federal agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture, have been met.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once customs officials have decided that the shipment and its documentation are in order, the goods are allowed to proceed into the U.S. The broker then determines the duties or fees payable and files this information, along with any payment due, with U.S. Customs. After official appraisal of the goods, the entry is \u201cliquidated,\u201d meaning that the final computation of duties and\/or drawback is complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information, see the government site: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca\/tcs-sdc\/guides\/us-export_eu\/141461.aspx?lang=eng#cle105\">https:\/\/www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca\/tcs-sdc\/guides\/us-export_eu\/141461.aspx?lang=eng#cle105<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Here is a link to see a checklist for exporting commercial goods from Canada: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/export\/checklist-controle-eng.html\">https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/export\/checklist-controle-eng.html<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing List<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The packing list outlines key information about your shipment such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contents<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total number of packages<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As your goods will be handled by different logistics and transportation providers, the packing list functions as a verification tool to make sure all goods are accounted for and reach their final destination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The packing list may also be used to verify information about the shipment against other documents, such as a commercial invoice, to make sure all information is accurate and consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This safety measure may help avoid errors at customs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CUSTOMS CLEARANCE CANADA<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Before importing, do your homework.
