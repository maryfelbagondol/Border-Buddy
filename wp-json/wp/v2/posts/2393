Known in Canada as CUSMA, in the US as USMCA, and in Mexico as T-MEC, this trade agreement has benefitted many importers and exporters across North America. After the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, CUSMA was a welcome revitalization to trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CUSMA has several advantages for small- and medium-sized businesses, but how can you make the most of them? What tips should you keep in mind as you expand your importing and exporting to other countries in North America?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Easily export to foreign markets<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2019, trade between Canada, the US, and Mexico accounted for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.international.gc.ca\/trade-commerce\/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux\/agr-acc\/cusma-aceum\/benefits-sme_avantages-pme.aspx?lang=eng\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.5 trillion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CAD). With their geographic proximity and cultural similarities, these three countries foster a great deal of trade with each other. In Canada, for example, 81% of exporting firms exported goods to the US in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your small business can benefit from tapping into this enormous trade market, which CUSMA makes easier and more straightforward. One important aspect of CUSMA is that there\u2019s no physical presence requirement. If your US business wants to export to Canada, for example, you don\u2019t need a local Canadian office to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the major differences between CUSMA and NAFTA? Read our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/cusma-usmca-and-nafta-acronyms-and-policies-explained\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Streamlined customs procedures<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When moving your goods across borders in CUSMA countries, you\u2019ll have fewer obstacles from customs. Origin certificates, which are sometimes required to move goods across borders, are much easier to get. With NAFTA, only the exporter or producer could complete the certificate of origin, and it had to be signed in wet ink.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under CUSMA, either the importer, exporter, or producer of the goods can complete the certificate of origin and they can sign it electronically. This new procedure will save your business time and hassle when moving your goods through customs. It\u2019s also easier for importers to claim preferential tariff treatment on low-value goods. For example, Canada doesn\u2019t require a certificate of origin if the value of the duty doesn\u2019t exceed $3,300 (CAD).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have questions about customs regulations under CUSMA, you can also contact a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/the-benefits-of-hiring-a-customs-broker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">certified customs broker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2395\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4968391-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Send e-commerce goods to expanding markets<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most beneficial provisions of CUSMA is the facilitation of cross-border e-commerce. Consumers in each CUSMA country, Mexico in particular, are purchasing more and more goods via e-commerce. With technological updates to customs procedures and the free flow of data across the borders CUSMA guarantees, online businesses can easily expand to new markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Promote your digital products<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CUSMA is a trade agreement for the digital age. It revamped provisions on trading digital products to boost digital services and e-commerce across borders. Under CUSMA, imported and exported digital products are duty-free. Also, no country can impose data-localization requirements, meaning that the US cannot force Canadian companies to store data on US servers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing data to move easily across borders lets e-commerce businesses transfer international customer data and track product shipments. In additional efforts to encourage trade in digital products, CUSMA also implemented cybersecurity measures to prevent the counterfeiting of intellectual property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need answers about importing digital products into Canada? Read our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-importing-and-exporting-digital-products-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Reduce your shipping costs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a small- or medium-sized business, the cost of international shipping can sometimes be prohibitive. CUSMA rules regarding de minimis values are especially important for smaller businesses that want to expand to foreign markets. De minimis is the minimum threshold a country sets for goods to be dutiable or taxable. Goods that fall under this threshold don\u2019t require as much paperwork and can clear customs more quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada raised its de minimis value to $40 (CAD) and Mexico to $50 (USD), meaning taxes and duties are all but eliminated for orders below these thresholds. Without duties and regulatory burdens placed on low-value shipments, smaller businesses can more easily trade in other CUSMA countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need help determining if your goods are duty-free?

With a single set of trade rules that apply across North America, your business will encounter fewer surprises or mishaps when moving goods across borders. More information about imports and exports is available to businesses online as well, so tracking shipments is less expensive and takes less time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Navigating CUSMA with a customs broker<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because CUSMA is still relatively new, some businesses may not yet fully realize how to take full advantage of it.
