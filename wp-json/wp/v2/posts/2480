There are approximately 25 million and 5 million potential customers in Australia and New Zealand, respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the cultural similarities to the US, Australians and Kiwis (the fun term for New Zealanders) tend to have a lot of the same tastes as Americans. Australians can\u2019t get enough <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancesmb.com\/us-retail-chains-in-australia-2892913\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kate Spade, Crocs, and Pizza Hut<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to name a few.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, exporting your products to a faraway country is never easy. It\u2019s vital to plan ahead so you can have the best chance of success. Whether you\u2019re expanding your booming domestic business to international markets or starting an import-export business specifically with Australasia in mind, here are some questions to ask before creating your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-sample-outline-for-your-export-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">export plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Is your product suitable for the target market?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your product is flying off the (digital) shelves in the US, chances are it may be successful in Australia and New Zealand as well. Still, it\u2019s necessary to size up your competitors to see if your product has a chance. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll probably have to charge more than local brands to cover shipping costs and tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps you\u2019re starting a brand-new export business and you\u2019re looking for the right product to send to Australia and New Zealand. Consider these top exports from the US to Australia and New Zealand:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machinery<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vehicles<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optical and medical instruments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pork<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dairy products<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepared food<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresh fruits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dog and cat food<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>2. How will you take opposite seasons into account?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When planning your export business, it\u2019s important to remember that Australia and New Zealand are in the Southern hemisphere. That means their winter is our summer, and vice versa. Keep this in mind as you\u2019re arranging your shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re exporting ski jackets, you\u2019ll probably need to plan for a peak season in June or July. Selling sunscreen, on the other hand, will give you a lot of business around Christmastime. Note that the typical summer break in both countries is from December to January, a time when many families take vacations.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Which shipping method will you choose?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Zealand is a whopping 7,800 miles (12,500 km) from the US, and Australia is even farther. That is a long way for your products to travel, no matter which shipping method you choose. Because of the long distance, you may be tempted to go with air freight to save time. This is certainly the fastest way to send your goods, taking only a couple days. It\u2019s also the most expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of its focus on the environment, New Zealand asks its trading partners to ship via ocean freight whenever possible. Although it takes a lot longer than air freight, ocean freight is much more cost-effective as well. Make sure you plan ahead as your goods could take a full month to reach their destination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2482\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-1024x664.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-300x194.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-768x498.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/johnny-bhalla-DLbCETd599Y-unsplash-2048x1328.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. How much will you pay in tariffs and duties?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re exporting to Australia, here\u2019s good news for you. The US has a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-complete-list-of-us-free-trade-agreements\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free trade agreement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Australia that eliminates taxes on 99% of manufactured goods and allows for duty-free farm exports. That being said, you may still be required to pay goods and services tax (GST) if you are importing goods directly to consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, New Zealand does not have a free trade agreement with the US. That doesn\u2019t mean you should give up on exporting there, however. Thankfully, the majority of goods don\u2019t have tariffs. For the categories of textiles, footwear, processed foods, machinery, steel, and plastic products, there may be a tariff rate of 5 or 10 percent. Check New Zealand\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.customs.govt.nz\/business\/tariffs\/working-tariff-document\/working-tariff-document\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working Tariff Document<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find out how much you\u2019re likely to pay.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. What\u2019s your product\u2019s Schedule B code?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When exporting from the US to any country, you must know your product\u2019s Schedule B code. This is a 10-digit code used specifically by US exporters to identify their products. Your product\u2019s Schedule B code should have the same first 6 numbers as its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/american-tariff-basics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">harmonized system (HS) code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the correct Schedule B code using the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uscensus.prod.3ceonline.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Census Bureau Schedule B search engine tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You will need your Schedule B code to file your Electronic Export Information in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trade.gov\/filing-your-export-shipments-through-automated-export-system-aes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automated Export System (AES)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Which import certificates do you need?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When exporting to Australia, start by registering for an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ppsr.gov.au\/glossary\/arbn-australian-registered-body-number\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Australian Registered Body Number (ARBN)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Keep in mind that you may need a special import license for specific products such as food and agricultural products. Make sure everything is labeled properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exporting to New Zealand requires <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.customs.govt.nz\/business\/import\/lodge-your-import-entry\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitting an electronic import entry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Customs at least 20 days before your goods arrive. If you\u2019re importing food, you\u2019ll need to register with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mpi.govt.nz\/import\/food\/food-importing-requirements\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ministry of Primary Industries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a food importer. This may involve obtaining various certifications from US agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. How will the customs process affect your delivery timeline?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since New Zealand is notoriously strict when it comes to inspecting imports, you should expect your products to be quarantined and detained before reaching your customers. Take this into account when calculating your delivery timeline so you can ensure any customs delays don\u2019t affect your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Australia tends to allow goods to enter its borders more quickly, it\u2019s still possible to have a customs delay. Make sure you don\u2019t cut it too close when promising to deliver your shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your business ready to expand to international markets? You need an experienced customs broker to assist you with the process. BorderBuddy can help get your goods through customs and ensure you follow all regulations.
