When it comes to international insurance, however, risk-taking might not be the best choice. All it takes is one catastrophe to make you regret not investing in insurance for your shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance for your import-export business comes in a variety of different forms, and it can be difficult to choose which types of insurance are necessary for your company.\u00a0 There are risks that come with not having international insurance. Here are the benefits of different types of import-export insurance and additional precautions you can take to protect your shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Do You Need Import Export Insurance?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the import-export business, your goods have a long journey from the supplier to your doorstep. A lot can happen along the way, no matter which shipping method you choose: air freight or sea courier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the potential hardships your shipments can face during transit:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goods are stolen en route<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goods are damaged during handling<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goods damage someone else\u2019s goods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goods are damaged by a fire or storm<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your employees are injured while transporting your goods<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just a few of the scenarios when insurance comes in handy for your import-export business. Frankly, you never know what could happen with international shipments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you need import-export insurance? The short answer is yes\u2013unless you\u2019re willing to risk your entire investment and can cover your losses if something happens. No matter how big or small your import-export business is, you can benefit from the peace of mind that comes from having international insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if your supplier or buyer already purchased insurance? Investigate and check whether the policy is reliable. If you feel unsettled about it, you can buy a contingent policy for about half the price of regular insurance. That way, your goods are safely insured in case of a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2074\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/matthew-waring-MJAoiige14E-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>6 Types of Insurance for Your Import Export Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve accepted the necessity of import-export insurance, it\u2019s time to decide which type of insurance is most suitable for your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are six kinds of international insurance you should consider. Remember, the more you invest in insurance, the safer your business will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Cargo Insurance<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re going to choose just one insurance plan for your import-export business, consider this one. Cargo insurance typically covers your goods from the time they leave the supplier to the moment they reach the buyer. You\u2019re protected from most calamities with cargo all-risk insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as marine insurance, cargo insurance is typically about 1% of the insured value. You can purchase cargo insurance directly from your freight forwarder or air courier. Once your business is big enough, you can invest in your own blanket policy that covers everything you ship for the duration of one year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Export Credit Insurance<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This insurance plan is designed specifically for small and medium-sized export businesses. Export credit insurance protects you if your buyer refuses to pay you for political or commercial reasons. This is especially helpful for new companies who are hesitant to enter the international market due to fear of failure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Export credit insurance costs anywhere from 0.5% to 2% of the invoice value, depending on risk exposure. You can obtain export credit insurance from an insurance broker such as Export Development Canada (EDC).<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Political Risk Insurance<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of insurance is intended for importers and exporters working with emerging economies. Political risk insurance is a safeguard against issues that result from political instability or discrimination. It\u2019s especially important since emerging economies tend to offer great trade markets but can be often overlooked due to risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of political risk insurance varies by country. Contact an insurance broker such as AIG Canada for pricing details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2075\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pawel-czerwinski-RovCBKMfK_k-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>4. International Product Liability Insurance<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This coverage is specifically for your products as an exporter. It shields you in the event of product liability claims lawsuits. We recommend this insurance for every exporter, even if your products are seemingly harmless. After all, you don\u2019t want to go bankrupt due to a claim that the jewelry you export is made with toxic glue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International product liability insurance pricing depends on the country where the products are sold and the potential liability hazards of the products. Reach out to an insurance broker such as AIG Canada for a quote.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This insurance policy is meant to mitigate against the potential losses from changes in currency rates. It\u2019s particularly useful since there\u2019s no way to predict whether a currency will remain stable, and even a slight change can result in a huge loss for import-export companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of foreign exchange risk insurance varies from 0.7% to 1% of the insured contract value, depending on which currencies need to be insured. You can purchase foreign exchange risk insurance from an insurance broker such as EDC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>6. Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as your business grows to the point of hiring employees, you\u2019ll probably need to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance. This coverage protects your employees in the event of an accident or injury.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not you are legally obligated to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance depends on your province. Consult your insurance agent for specific requirements and pricing details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2076\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-elevate-1267329-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Further Precautions to Take to Protect Your Shipments<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of which kinds of insurance you choose to invest in, it\u2019s beneficial for you to do everything in your power to protect your shipments from harm. It\u2019s better to avoid a potential problem than to have to deal with the hassle of filing for reimbursement from the insurance company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some additional precautions you can take to give your goods the best chance of arriving safely:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use protective packaging. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goods need to be safeguarded from forklifts, mold, humidity, and other potential hazards.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterproof everything. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You never know what kind of weather your goods will be subject to throughout the journey, so it\u2019s best to use waterproof lining and packaging whenever possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t use trademarks or content descriptions. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing a package contains valuable items might tempt a thief along the way.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to prepare for every situation by purchasing the right insurance and taking steps to protect your goods.
