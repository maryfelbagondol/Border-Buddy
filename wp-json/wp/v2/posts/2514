Whether you\u2019re curating an eclectic garden in your backyard or running a profitable exotic plant business, the importing and exporting of plants, seeds and flowers is a booming industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals purchasing for personal use may find exotic plants in Thailand, Vietnam, or South America they can\u2019t find at home. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/11\/11\/style\/tropical-plants-rare.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are people obsessed with plants turning up with moving trucks at plant shows like Miami\u2019s annual International Aroid Society Show and Sale. Not to mention, folks bidding for plants on eBay for up to $2,700 (USD)!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nurseries and plant shops may find that to compete, it helps to have a more exciting variety of merchandise, including plants from overseas or just across the border. For these business owners, importing plants and seeds may also prove to be more economical than growing their own on location.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what the purpose, when importing or exporting plants in Canada or the US, you must know what government parties are involved to be sure you are complying with all regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Importing plants to the US<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When importing plants from foreign countries, make sure they meet entry requirements as stated by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/help.cbp.gov\/s\/article\/Article-600?language=en_US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customs and Border Protection<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

If the officer finds plant pests that could cause harm to other plants, or if the plants do not meet entry requirements, they will be refused entry. This means you must forfeit the plants, which will either be destroyed or returned to the country of origin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travelers are advised to consult with their nearest APHIS PPQ Plant Inspection Station to determine the admissibility of propagative plant material (including live plants, bulbs, corms, cuttings, root crowns, seeds, etc.).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can learn more about admissibility and entry requirements for specific plants by calling Permit Services at (301) 851-2046 or toll-free at

List<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is a list of plants considered low-risk that may be imported as long as you meet basic requirements. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/canada\/2020\/02\/12\/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-import-or-export-rare-plants-in-canada.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Toronto Star<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, some of the internet\u2019s hottest plants \u2014 monsteras, philodendrons and anthuriums \u2014 are allowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the country\u2019s national plant protection organization, and it regulates how plants enter and leave the country. The Star spoke with Patricia McAllister, a national manager with the CFIA, to see what people need to do to ensure their plants make it to Canada safely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What are the basic requirements?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as in the States, an import permit is needed. You need to get one from the CFIA through its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/inspection.gc.ca\/about-the-cfia\/my-cfia\/eng\/1482204298243\/1482204318353\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online portal, <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the plant\u2019s seller needs to make sure there is a phytosanitary certificate from the country of export.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAll plant movement is essentially regulated under the International Plant Protection Convention,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cEssentially, the goal is if you have a pest, keep it; if you don\u2019t have a pest, don\u2019t let anyone send it to you. It really is about preventing the movement of pests between countries with plant material.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a phytosanitary certificate? It is a plant passport. It shows who grew the plant, where it is traveling to, where it originated from, confirming that the plant meets Canada\u2019s requirements. Only a National Plant Protection Organization can issue a phytosanitary certificate. (In Canada, the CFIA issues these certificates for people who are exporting plants to other countries. If you\u2019re planning to export a plant, contact your local CFIA office for next steps.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if my plant doesn\u2019t have this paperwork? Your plant could be destroyed or returned to its country of origin. If you\u2019re buying from an international seller, it\u2019s wise to confirm they are sending a phytosanitary certificate from their country with your plant. An import permit from the CFIA must be issued <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inspection.gc.ca\/plant-health\/plant-pests-invasive-species\/plant-import\/before-you-apply-for-a-permit\/eng\/1343414402266\/1343414628852\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your plant leaves its country of origin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What about endangered plants?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Endangered plants are managed through Environment Canada.

The<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inspection.gc.ca\/plant-health\/plant-pests-invasive-species\/directives\/imports\/d-08-04\/appendix-7\/eng\/1324619570286\/1324620215710\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> list of eligible plants <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is on the CFIA website.
