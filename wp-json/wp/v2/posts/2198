What\u2019s the difference between duties, tariffs, and taxes? One thing people don\u2019t know is that the terms duty and tariff are often used interchangeably to refer to a kind of tax that applies to importing and exporting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone With the Wind, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Mitchell wrote, \u201cDeath, taxes, and childbirth! There\u2019s never any convenient time for any of them.\u201d Nevertheless, taxes are a key part of the import-export process and must be paid according to the regulations of the countries of your supply chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To run your import-export business successfully, you need to be aware of the duties\/tariffs that apply to your products. Failing to have an adequate understanding of this component of importing\/exporting could result in surprise fees and legal problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is a tax?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tax is simply a charge imposed by the government for public purposes. You\u2019re probably familiar with income tax&#8230;and you\u2019ve probably complained about it from time to time. Every national government has its own way of imposing taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re an American who lives in a state that\u2019s not Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, or Oregon, you\u2019re used to paying a price that\u2019s different from the price tag. This is because of sales tax. Canadians are also used to this phenomenon. Visitors from other countries, however, are often surprised to find that they must pay more than the price on the menu or item.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is a duty?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A duty is a type of tax that is levied on imports or exports, meaning it applies to products that are transported between two or more countries. As previously stated, duty and tariff are often used interchangeably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duties are typically used by governments to create revenue or to protect domestic industries. For example, if the US were to place a high duty on Dutch potatoes, American potato farmers would have a better chance of selling their potatoes domestically. This could create some hard feelings between the US and the Netherlands. That\u2019s why duties can often play into politics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that you may not need to pay tariffs if there is a relevant <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free trade agreement (FTA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s helpful to check whether your country and the country you\u2019re importing from have an FTA between them.

For example, over 20% of Kazakhstan\u2019s tax revenue comes from export duties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some countries choose to place export taxes on a particular product in order to take advantage of their monopoly on that product and generate more revenue. This puts a heavy burden on foreign consumers and often drives importing countries to search for new supply sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are an importer, it\u2019s wise to check whether the country you are importing from charges export tariffs. You\u2019ll want to factor them into your pricing. Neither the US nor Canada levies export taxes. In fact, the US Constitution forbids it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Import duties<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Import duties are the most common type of tariff. Most countries have instituted them. Of course, a free trade agreement (FTA) may waive or reduce the import duties. There are two main ways that import duties are collected: specific and ad valorem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A specific duty is calculated based on the weight, length, or mass of the goods. For example, you might be charged $3.00 per pound or $5.00 per meter. This is the easiest way to calculate import duties because the value of the goods is already assumed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ad valorem duty, on the other hand, is a percentage of the total value of the goods. Perhaps you would pay 5% of your import value. This is where things get a bit trickier because authorities need to determine whether the goods have been valued properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2202\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/pexels-christina-morillo-1181307-2048x1367.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to figure out which tariff to pay<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining which tariff to pay is something you should do early on. Because each country has different tariff guidelines, it\u2019s important to be aware of tariff rates when building your supply chain. Follow these three steps to get a good estimate of what you will owe.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Find the HS code that classifies your goods<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you need to determine the specific Harmonized System (HS) code that applies to your products. HS codes are used by most countries to classify goods throughout the import export process. Most of the time, you\u2019re looking for a six-digit HS code, but sometimes it can be more than six digits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to find your HS code is by using this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost.ca\/information\/app\/wtz\/business\/findHsCode?execution=e1s1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HS Code Finder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The US has a unique system for exporters that involves Schedule B codes. If you are exporting from the US, check which Schedule B code applies to your goods <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uscensus.prod.3ceonline.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Keep in mind that Schedule B codes are specifically for exporting from the US, and imports to the US usually require an HS code instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Check if there is a free trade agreement that affects your shipments<\/b><b><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, free trade agreements (FTAs) between two countries generally specify that tariffs are reduced or nonexistent. FTAs also tend to make the customs process easier by not requiring as much paperwork. One of the most well-known FTAs is the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which facilitates trade between these three countries by getting rid of most tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are importing to the US or exporting from the US, check if the country you\u2019re trading with is one of the 20 countries that have FTAs with the US. Canada has free trade agreements with 51 countries, all of which can be found <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Verify the tariff rate that applies to your products<\/b><b><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last step is figuring out which tariff rate applies to your goods. In order to do this, you need to have the HS code or Schedule B code for your products on hand. Make sure you have a detailed description of your products to confirm that the code is accurate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The International Trade Administration offers an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.trade.gov\/fta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTA Tariff Tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for those importing or exporting from the US to a country that has an FTA with the US.
