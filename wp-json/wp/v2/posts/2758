Simply crossing the US\/Canada border often has travelers scrambling for answers. For example, fruit, a surprisingly illegal, seemingly innocuous thing to pack as a road trip snack. Shipping can be even more mystifying, as you\u2019re not physically present to manage and respond to questions.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important for you to know that there are some gray areas that are hard to completely avoid, with different state and federal laws in the US on certain items. We still recommend that you check with your carrier for shipping, as regulations may vary depending on what shipping service you use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When in doubt, contact us.<\/strong> This is our jam, avoiding you getting into expensive\/illegal shipping-related jams. The time and risks you\u2019ll save by getting clear, expert human answers is more than worth it.<\/p>\n<h3>Restricted Goods VS Illegal\/Prohibited Goods<\/h3>\n<p>How can two words be so similar and yet so drastically different, ramifications-wise? There are significant differences and penalties if you mistake a prohibited good for a restricted one, which often has lots of asterisks, but with the right guidelines followed, it is permitted. Prohibited goods can leave you in hot water or worse, as they are simply illegal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s start with the ILLEGAL items for shipping from Canada to the USA:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcoholic beverages<\/li>\n<li>Animal skins (non-domesticated)<\/li>\n<li>Articles of exceptional value (ie. works of art, antiques, precious stones, gold and silver)<\/li>\n<li>Currency<\/li>\n<li>Dangerous goods\/hazardous materials (following IATA regulations for Express and Expedited, and following ADR regulations for Standard)<\/li>\n<li>Drug paraphernalia<\/li>\n<li>Embargoed goods<\/li>\n<li>Firearms<\/li>\n<li>Fish, game, meat, poultry, fruit, vegetables and their products<\/li>\n<li>Furs<\/li>\n<li>Human or animal remains or parts<\/li>\n<li>Ivory and ivory products<\/li>\n<li>Liquids, liquefiable substances and powders<\/li>\n<li>Live animals<\/li>\n<li>Manufactured goods bearing insufficient markings or origin<\/li>\n<li>Margarine or butter substitutes<\/li>\n<li>Medical material, including specimens<\/li>\n<li>Merchandise from embargoed countries and more<\/li>\n<li>Metallic labels<\/li>\n<li>Money or negotiable items<\/li>\n<li>Perishable goods<\/li>\n<li>Plants<\/li>\n<li>Poisonous or infectious substances<\/li>\n<li>Pornographic materials<\/li>\n<li>Prescription drugs<\/li>\n<li>Seeds<\/li>\n<li>Tobacco and tobacco products<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are official government links for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/export\/guide-eng.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBSA<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/document\/publications\/importing-united-states\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US CBP<\/a>, but in total candor, they may cause you more uncertainty than calm. So &#8211; this is a friendly reminder and not a shameless plug: BorderBuddy agents are here to help answer any and all questions. We\u2019re called \u201cBuddy\u201d for a reason, we\u2019re your friends with all of the soothing answers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prohibited items for shipping TO Canada from the USA:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bee-Keeping apparatus, used ?<\/li>\n<li>Chain letters and other literature pertaining to fraudulent schemes<\/li>\n<li>Contraceptive devices and literature<\/li>\n<li>Corrosives, nuclear substances or oxidizing substances<\/li>\n<li>Counterfeit or imitation coins<\/li>\n<li>Firearms, weapons and ammunition<\/li>\n<li>Gold bullion, gold dust or non-manufactured metals<\/li>\n<li>Hate propaganda<\/li>\n<li>Manufactured goods bearing insufficient markings or origin<\/li>\n<li>Margarine or butter substitutes<\/li>\n<li>Metallic labels<\/li>\n<li>Obscene, immoral, indecent or scurrilous matter<\/li>\n<li>Poisonous or infectious substances<\/li>\n<li>Prison-made goods<\/li>\n<li>Unlawful lottery tickets and advertising<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>International goods being shipped to Canada or the USA: Illegal<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aerosols<\/li>\n<li>Air bags<\/li>\n<li>Alcoholic beverages<\/li>\n<li>Ammunition<\/li>\n<li>Cigarettes<\/li>\n<li>Dry ice<\/li>\n<li>Explosives<\/li>\n<li>Gasoline<\/li>\n<li>Marijuana (medical or otherwise)<\/li>\n<li>Perfumes (containing alcohol)<\/li>\n<li>Poison<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Restricted items: murky but manageable, with BorderBuddy<\/h3>\n<p>These are restricted but not altogether prohibited, depending on your carrier and if requisite forms have been filled out and\/or prepared in advance. One theme you\u2019ll see across prohibited and restricted items are anything organic, or living. We\u2019ve seen with the COVID-19 pandemic how essential it is that we track anything with the potential to mutate, and that includes living organisms like fruit, animals and even seeds. The restricted items (the asterisk items that may need more paperwork\/logistics management) to and from Canada &#8211; USA are the same.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shipping TO and FROM Canada &#8211; USA<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flowers<\/li>\n<li>Lithium ion and lithium metal batteries<\/li>\n<li>Perishable goods<\/li>\n<li>Pharmaceuticals<\/li>\n<li>Plants<\/li>\n<li>Seeds<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the most confusing, as restrictions are less black and white than prohibited\/illegal. This is not to freak you out, but the Canadian Border Services Agency is pretty clear in all that you\u2019re responsible to manage as an exporter, but a bit light on digestible information.<\/p>\n<p>From the Canadian Border Services Agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/export\/guide-eng.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website<\/a>,: \u201cAs an exporter, it is in your best interest to be as accurate and as thorough as possible in your export reporting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Proactively seeking guidance from federal departments that control and regulate exports will help you to understand the requirements. This could also help to avoid costly delays at the time of export. If you\u2019ve ever dealt with government agencies, it can be a real time suck and you may find yourself feeling inexplicably panicked, uneasy, even defensive over totally legitimate questions. Avoid that &#8211; contact BorderBuddy and our dedicated team members will clarify any uncertainties you may have, and may even have additional tips or insights to put your mind at ease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As a reminder:<\/strong> \u201cThe CBSA may take enforcement action, including monetary penalties, seize goods as forfeit, and lay criminal charges, when Canada&#8217;s export laws have been contravened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s avoid that. Our list is helpful and hopefully you\u2019ve found the answers to your questions. But when in doubt, just drop us a line or chat with us on our website. There\u2019s no reason to add extra stress (or financial losses, criminal charges, etc) to what can be a seamless, rewarding experience.<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions, BorderBuddy can help at <a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to what you can and can\u2019t ship.
