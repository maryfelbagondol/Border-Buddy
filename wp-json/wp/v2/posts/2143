Countries that were previously open to Americans and Canadians, like those in the EU, are now closed. China has completely closed its borders to almost every country. It\u2019s difficult to know when things will be \u201cnormal\u201d again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These border closures and travel restrictions were done in the name of preventing the virus from spreading, but it seems as though there is also a political component influencing who is allowed to travel and where. Alas, international politics often play a role in where you\u2019re allowed to travel&#8230;and where you can ship things as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For importers and exporters, it\u2019s important to be aware of the embargoes that are in place for the country you\u2019re based in. You also need to know about tariffs placed on certain products so you can know which products have the potential to earn a profit. Every country is different, so it\u2019s wise to do your research in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is an embargo?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An embargo is essentially a ban on trade with another country. Powerful nations will often implement an embargo to try to force another country to act on a certain political issue. For example, the US and other countries enforced an embargo on South Africa in the 1980s to show their opposition to apartheid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several different types of embargoes. The most severe is a total ban of trade of any kind. Sometimes certain products such as food and medicine are excluded from the embargo. Another common type of embargo is an arms embargo, which prevents arms and related materials from reaching the targeted country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can your import-export business be impacted by embargoes? The only way you will be affected is if there is an embargo in place between two of the countries in your supply chain. Check carefully to make sure no such embargo exists before creating your business plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most well-known embargo may be the US embargo on Cuba. It has been in force for almost 60 years. Under this sanction, Americans intending to import from Cuba or export to Cuba must obtain a special permit to do so. If you were planning on involving Cuba in your supply chain, you might need to reconsider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2144\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/alexander-kunze-uLh71gTmZ4g-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Embargoes in the US and Canada<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada and the US each have a list of countries they have an embargo on. As an importer or exporter, it\u2019s best to avoid trade with these countries because of the need to obtain a special license.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US currently has a trade embargo on the following countries:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuba<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iran<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Korea<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syria<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US has other sanctions that involve restrictions on certain imports and exports and\/or restricted transactions with certain parties in the following countries: Belarus, Burma, Burundi, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Hong Kong, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nicaragua, Russia\/Ukraine, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. If you plan to trade with a country on this list, further investigation will be needed to determine whether it is possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada currently has a trade embargo on the following countries:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iran<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libya<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Somalia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Syria<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are based in a country that\u2019s not the US or Canada, make sure you check if they have any embargoes in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is a tariff?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tariff is a tax that is placed on products that are imported from another country. Typically, a country chooses to implement a tariff in order to protect domestic industries. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s very cheap to produce curtains in India, and it\u2019s expensive to make curtains in Canada (higher wages and benefits, more costly materials, etc). If Canada does not enforce a tariff on Indian curtains, most Canadians will choose to buy Indian curtains because they are cheaper. Canadian curtain manufacturers will likely go out of business. With a tariff on Indian curtains in place, Canadian curtains will be more likely to sell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are some benefits for the country that implements tariffs, it also can create tension and retaliation between the two countries in question. This is evident in the US-China Trade War. President Trump began by placing a high tariff on Chinese goods, and China responded by enforcing retaliatory tariffs. Both countries are suffering from this conflict.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an importer or exporter, you may need to pay tariffs on your shipments. Keep in mind that you may be required to pay other taxes and customs fees such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/whats-the-difference-between-gst-hst-and-pst\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goods and Services Tax (GST)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Canadian imports as well. It\u2019s important to know in advance how much you owe so that you can create a thorough budget for your import-export business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2146\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/hanny-naibaho-mnyJEvSLtvk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to determine which tariff to pay<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re in the process of choosing which products to sell and where to find a supplier, investigate whether you need to pay tariffs on the products. If you find that the tariffs are exceptionally high on a certain product imported from a certain country, you may want to find a different product (or a supplier in a different country). Here\u2019s how you can find out an estimate of what you might owe in tariffs.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Locate the HS code that classifies your goods<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to look for the specific Harmonized System (HS) code for your goods. Most countries use HS codes to classify traded products throughout the import-export process. Your HS code will usually be six digits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost.ca\/information\/app\/wtz\/business\/findHsCode?execution=e1s1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HS Code Finder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to determine your HS code. If you are exporting from the US, you need to find a Schedule B code for your product <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uscensus.prod.3ceonline.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Schedule B codes are used only for exporting from the US; imports to the US typically use an HS code instead.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Find out if there is a free trade agreement in the country you\u2019re trading with<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free trade agreements (FTAs) are an important aspect of international trade. When a country has an FTA with another country, tariffs are usually greatly reduced or nonexistent. FTAs also make the customs process easier by cutting away some of the red tape. One example of an FTA is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This agreement allows trade between these three countries to transpire largely without tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US currently has FTAs with 20 countries. Check if you can benefit from one of these agreements. If you are importing to Canada or exporting from Canada, you can find all of Canada\u2019s free trade agreements <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Determine the tariff rate that applies to your goods<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final part of the process is checking which tariff rate applies to your goods. Once you have the HS code or Schedule B code for your products, you can look up the applicable tariff rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are importing to the US or exporting from the US and the country you\u2019re trading with has an FTA with the US, utilize the International Trade Administration\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.trade.gov\/fta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTA Tariff Tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you are importing to Canada or exporting from Canada, you can find tariffs listed on the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/trade-commerce\/tariff-tarif\/2021\/menu-eng.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating the ever-changing details of embargoes and tariffs can be challenging.
