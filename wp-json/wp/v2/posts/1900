This provides a perfect opportunity for you to create your own import-export business. Whether it\u2019s importing beautiful textiles from another continent or exporting local Canadian products abroad, all you need is passion and drive to get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You probably have plenty of ideas swirling around in your head, but the only way to make your business a reality and ensure your success is to write a winning business plan. Business plans are notoriously long and complex but don\u2019t be disheartened. Here are 6 steps to writing the perfect business plan for your import-export company:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1.<\/strong> <b>Start with an Executive Summary.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of this as the ultimate introduction to your business. It should concisely delineate exactly what you want as a business owner. Remember, you need to know where your business is going. It\u2019s up to you to clarify your vision. No one is going to be as passionate about your import-export storefront as you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your executive summary should have:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business concept<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: what you\u2019ll sell, who will purchase it, and why your business will work<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial points<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: your sales, profits, cash flows, and ROI<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Required finances<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: what capital is needed and how it will be used<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current business state<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: a short history of your business including key members of staff<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achievements<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: may include test marketing, facility locations, important contracts, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Keep it short and sweet. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, your executive summary will be no more than half a page. The rest of your business plan is where you\u2019ll go into greater detail about these components.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might be helpful to go through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-to-start-an-import-export-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Start an Import Export Business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before you create your executive summary to ensure everything is carefully thought out before you present it in your business plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1898\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-energepiccom-110473-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Include a Business Description.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is your opportunity to describe exactly what you\u2019re importing or exporting and how it will succeed. Are you importing Congolese avocados? Show how you can guarantee perfect ripeness when they reach stores. Are you exporting blenders to Bolivia? Demonstrate you\u2019ve found the perfect blender to suit the demand of that market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some questions to consider and incorporate:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does the industry look now and how might it change in the future?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your business brand new or already established?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What kind of business is it (e.g. partnership, corporation)?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the ins and outs of the distribution of your product?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is your business better than your competitors?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What exactly makes your business profitable?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Don\u2019t forget insurance.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Investors and lenders need to see you\u2019re responsible <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and won\u2019t lose money from major oversights. You might think skipping product insurance will help you make more money, but this is a huge mistake in the long run. Find a premium insurance company and include that information in your business description.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Conduct a Market Analysis.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roll up your sleeves\u2014this part takes a lot of effort. If you put the work in and do\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the research, it will pay off. The point of your market analysis is to demonstrate your knowledge of the market and your ability to claim a significant share of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great market analysis can look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Define the market<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: talk about size, trends, rules and regulations, prospective growth areas, and sales potential<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nail down the total feasible market<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: specifically address the portion of the market your business can realistically capture<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estimate market share<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: take into consideration industry growth and your product\u2019s life cycle<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine pricing<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: discuss your reasons for pricing and how you will cover costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Explain your promotion strategy<\/span>: this includes advertising, packaging, PR, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Factor in exchange rates.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As you\u2019re figuring out your price, be sure to include\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exchange rates in your calculations. Neglecting this could sink your<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business. You might want to consider using the local currency of the country you\u2019re working with, especially if they use an international currency such as euros or US dollars. Are you planning on exporting to the EU? Don\u2019t miss <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/exporting-to-the-eu-a-guide-for-canadian-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this helpful guide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1897\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/pexels-olya-kobruseva-4678322-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Summarize a Competitive Analysis.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not quite the same as your market analysis, your competitive analysis focuses mainly on the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. Planning to import Italian cars? Put yourself in your buyer\u2019s shoes. What options do they have for purchasing an Italian car? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you make a list of all your potential competitors, you\u2019ll want to organize all the information in a competitive strength grid, which outlines which competitors are strong in each skill category and which ones are weak (e.g. price, product quality).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you\u2019ll need to clearly define your competitive advantage. Do you have a\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower price point? Are your cars of better quality? Do you have a more solid advertising plan? Can you break into a new market?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Your price equates to your product\u2019s value. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you price your product too far below your competitors, it may cheapen your product in the eyes of consumers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to outpace your competitors in pricing, but make sure you don\u2019t overdo it and cause your customers to overlook your product due to a lower perceived quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.<\/strong> <b>Create a Design &amp; Development Plan.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where you focus on details, details, details. How are you going to make <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your business a reality? Now is your opportunity to get it all on paper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some questions to answer in this section:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your goals for product development?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which procedures will you have in place for product review, marketing, and distribution?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is your exact production schedule?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s in your detailed development budget?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many employees need to be recruited and in what areas?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What possible risks are apparent?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will your business function on a continuing basis?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the organizational structure of your business?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve left any of these questions unanswered, you\u2019ll need to add more details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t go it alone. You might prefer to do everything on your own, but that will only leave you overworked and exhausted. There are so many specifics in the import-export world that you can easily get overwhelmed.
