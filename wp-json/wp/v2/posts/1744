Trade is not halted, however, the impact from countries hard hit by COVID-19 is still reverberating around the globe. There is a backlog of all non-essential goods at ports. Given all the upheaval with border closures and travel restrictions, this is an enormous challenge for any business owner. Supply chains around the globe are impacted, and many businesses\u2019 bottom lines have taken a hit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/daily-quotidien\/200604\/dq200604a-eng.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statistics Canada<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Exports fell 29.7% to $32.7 billion in April 2020, the lowest level in more than 10 years. Imports were down 25.1% to $35.9 billion, a value not seen since February 2011. Consumer goods and cars are two sectors that have been impacted the most.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social distancing and stay-at-home orders have left gaps in the market, and creative businesses are discovering ways to fill those gaps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is experiencing operational hurdles, you may need to change product offerings and services in the wake of COVID-19. If you\u2019re clever, you may be able to find inventive ways to reassess the way you do business and stay connected with customers through it all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can you do to combat this crisis?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>These are 4 Tips On Pivoting Your Import Business To Weather The Covid-19 Pandemic.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>1.\u00a0 Communicate with your customers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1747\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/pexels-bongkarn-thanyakij-3843324-2048x1151.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers need to know what\u2019s going on. If you\u2019re honest, they will appreciate that you are both in the same boat, trying to navigate this new normal, and at least you have connected on a human level. Customer feedback surveys are a good way for you to understand concerns and challenges. Meeting customers\u2019 needs with honesty and transparency will go a long way toward retaining their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Communicate with your suppliers\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping commerce move is a priority for all governments, but obviously, there are situations that are logistically impossible due to limited staff, border closures, and backed up shipments. Get a handle on what complications may be arising for your suppliers and if necessary, it may come down to invoking a force majure to protect yourself from contract obligations that can no longer be fulfilled. You may need to consult an attorney to navigate involved contract negotiations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Reevaluate your supply chain<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your supply chain is impacted by countries hard hit by COVID-19, you must get creative with looking at different products, or different suppliers. Are there US partners that you can collaborate with to fill your orders?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several businesses pivoted during the last several months by using their resources and factories to produce critical products or services in support of combatting the pandemic. There are distilleries that now manufacture hand sanitizer; clothing manufacturers who were able to fabricate cloth face masks, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are food products you are unable to get, is there a way to turn to local farmers and producers who are now hard-hit due to restaurant closure? Maybe there is a win-win scenario where you can utilize local suppliers that need business, and they can help you fulfill orders to meet your customers\u2019 needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need to renegotiate the contract with your supplier, be sure that any change in value is formalized before complications arise. Formalization in writing is best in these cases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How can you continue importing products into Canada?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While restrictions have been placed on non-essential trips, the flow of commercial products has as of yet not been affected by COVID-19. Canadian customs authorities are currently still accepting shipments from overseas. As a matter of fact, the payment of taxes and duties has been deferred at this time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/revenue-agency\/campaigns\/covid-19-update\/frequently-asked-questions-gst-hst.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about the Deferral of GST\/HST Tax Remittances measures from the Government of Canada<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Be as proactive as you can<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigate whether there is any duty or tariff relief or extensions from CBP, USTR, etc.\u00a0 Reach-out to government contacts and stakeholder associations for updates on the global situation as it affects commerce.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the situation is changing every day, keep a close watch on international, federal, state, and local developments and global attempts to restrict the spread of the virus. Trade restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and curfews are impacted, so make sure you and your staff are apprised of any changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the complications of the last several months are making you realize you are overly-dependent on a global supply chain, you will now be forced to come up with solutions to prevent things like the COVID-19 pandemic from wreaking havoc on your business in the future. Therefore, you may think about changing your business model not just temporarily, but permanently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Export Development Canada (EDC)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the EDC <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edc.ca\/en\/campaign\/coronavirus-covid-19.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are working with our federal partners and financial institutions to bring financial relief and support to Canadian companies through the Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP).

Pressure will increase on some companies to shift away from China, where land costs and growing wages have already caused some production to move to lower-wage countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia.
