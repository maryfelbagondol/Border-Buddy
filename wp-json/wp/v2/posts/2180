It is important to get ahead of the problem and be proactive, rather than reactive to the crisis at hand.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are four important ways to strategize:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowering Risk. Do you have a backup plan? If you manufacture product overseas, you need to explore manufacturing locally. If you\u2019re selling internationally, are you selling to different markets or are you relying on one particular customer? Should currency fluctuate, do you have a strategy in place for foreign exchange?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk sharing. If you are focused solely on one product line you may want to branch out, so that if one side of your business takes a hit you have another business that is still healthy. Diversification is the answer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk reduction. Get the right professional help with your contracts. Allow for contingencies for working capital.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk transfer\/insurance. The biggest asset on your books is accounts receivable. Amira Dali, Senior Accounts Manager of EDC\u2019s Commercial Markets and Small Business advises, \u201cIf you\u2019re a company that\u2019s working with customizable goods, do you have contract cancellation insurance in case your contracts get canceled and you\u2019ve already incurred all those costs? If your goods are transported through the sea, do you have marine cargo insurance? Depending on the industry you\u2019re in, sometimes your contracts have letters of credit or bonding needs \u2013 performance bonds, advance payment bonds \u2013 are you protected? Do you have wrongful call insurance?\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><strong>Protection from payment default<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk of non-payment as a result of COVID-19 is top of mind for many Canadian exporters.

Transmission via surfaces that have recently been contaminated with viruses is, nonetheless, possible through smear infections. However, this is only likely to occur during a short period after contamination, due to the relatively low stability of coronaviruses in the environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can imported goods from regions where the disease has spread be sources of an infection in humans?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transmission methods recorded thus far, and the relatively low environmental stability of Coronaviruses, it is unlikely that imported goods such as imported foods or consumer goods and toys, tools, computers, clothes, or shoes may be sources of an infection with the new type of coronavirus, according to the current state of knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Protecting your workplace<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2176\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920.png 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-1536x1536.png 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-95x95.png 95w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-110x110.png 110w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-218x218.png 218w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/coronavirus-4981176_1920-65x65.png 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WHO offers these valuable guidelines for getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 on their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/docs\/default-source\/coronaviruse\/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=359a81e7_6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">site<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
