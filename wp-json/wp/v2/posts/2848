Whether you love them, loathe them or are intrigued by them, this article is for you! We\u2019ll explore some of the ways to find and compare ATVs to get the best prices and style for your needs. We will also touch on the legalities that delight BorderBuddy customs brokers, who want to be along for the ride for as long as it takes to seamlessly and securely get your ATV or ATVs imported or exported across the border.<\/p>\n<h3>What classifies as an ATV?<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve seen them all over the place, on the beaches with police, appearing out of nowhere in otherwise silent forests, even on city streets, in some tropical locales, like Puerto Vallarta. An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) <a href=\"https:\/\/atvsafety.org\/what-is-an-atv\/#:~:text=An%20all%2Dterrain%20vehicle%20(ATV,and%20handlebars%20for%20steering%20control.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is defined as<\/a> a \u201cmotorized off-highway vehicle designed to travel on four low-pressure or non-pneumatic tires, having a seat designed to be straddled by the operator and handlebars for steering control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ATVs as an industry have been <a href=\"https:\/\/atvsafety.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/PRSVIA060503FS_Emissions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working to lower their emissions<\/a> and increase their clean energy standards. In the U.S., ATV manufacturers have been working diligently with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of national emission standards. In Canada, they\u2019ve also released a set of standards, available <a href=\"https:\/\/dieselnet.com\/standards\/ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Paperwork requirements for importing into Canada<\/h3>\n<p>The Government of Canada regulates emissions from recreational engines, vessels, and off-road vehicles. This includes marine vessels, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and snowmobiles. Mandated by <strong>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)<\/strong>, the <strong>Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)<\/strong> details emission standards for air pollutants and toxic substances from fuel systems of these vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)<\/strong> assists in administering CEPA\u2019s requirements when importing the vehicles into Canada. <strong>Memorandum D19-7-4<\/strong>, Importation of Engines, Vehicles, Vessels and Machines outlines the requirements for the importation of recreational engines, vessels, and <strong>off-road vehicles<\/strong> (ATVs).<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/environment-climate-change\/services\/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry\/importation-declaration-form-marine-spark-engines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Import Declaration Form<\/a> must be completed in full before import for:<\/p>\n<h3>Off-Road Vehicles<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Snowmobiles, off-road motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and utility vehicles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <strong>Import Declaration Form<\/strong> must be completed by the importer of the above products when being into Canada for the purpose of sale and submitted to the Regulatory Administration Section, Transportation Division or Environment Canada.<\/p>\n<p>A complete list of all of the various import regulations pertaining to almost anything with a motor in Canada can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/terminalcityriders.ca\/articles\/importing-bikes-and-parts-to-canada\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>. It\u2019s pretty hefty and full of hard to remember acronyms, so while a helpful tool to keep on hand, your best bet is to contact one of our BorderBuddy customs brokers if you\u2019re unclear on or worried about anything.<\/p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s get ATV shopping!<\/h3>\n<p>Here are just a few sites that buy and sell new and used ATVs. Private sellers, like all purchases, have their benefits and their challenges. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kijiji.ca\/b-atv\/canada\/c311l0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kijiji has a surprisingly big inventory<\/a> of ATVs, so they are definitely worth a perusal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autotrader.ca\/motorcycles-atvs\/atv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Autotrader<\/a> is a very trusted name in the vehicle industry, mostly known for cars and trucks, they have diversified into ATVs and have a great selection. They also have solid paperwork and vehicle history records, so you may find that reassuring in making your choice. Another ATV buy and sell site that exclusively trades in ATVs is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atvtrader.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ATV Trader<\/a>. They carry every major brand, have full ownership histories and also sell some parts and gear.<\/p>\n<h3>When it\u2019s time to get your ATV across the border, you know who to call!<\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve made your decision, contact us and we\u2019ll get started on the duties and customs required by both borders to legally possess your ATV.
