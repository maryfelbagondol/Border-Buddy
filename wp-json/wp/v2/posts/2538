But if you\u2019re just starting to expand your business overseas, you may have never used one before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this guide, you\u2019ll learn when and why you need a commercial invoice, how to fill one out and the benefits of using commercial invoices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What is a commercial invoice?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial invoice is a document that provides information for border authorities, to help clear your goods through customs. It lets customs know what your goods are, where they are coming from, and any special attributes they need to know about. Customs authorities will look at a commercial invoice to determine if a shipment can be allowed in the country and if you have to pay any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/duties-tariffs-and-taxes-the-fees-of-importing-exporting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">duties<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courier services such as UPS or DHL also require a commercial invoice for international shipping, as it helps them transport the goods to the end customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>When do you need a commercial invoice for shipping?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anytime you export goods, you should have a commercial invoice. You also need one invoice for each shipment you send.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The format of a commercial invoice can vary, as long as the required information is included. Some countries may require you to use their specific templates. Canada has a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/publications\/forms-formulaires\/ci1-eng.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada Customs Invoice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that all US exporters must use for shipments valued at more than $2,500 (CAD).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The benefits of having a commercial invoice in shipping<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial invoices may be required, but they also provide several advantages that make the international shipping process go more smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A detailed commercial invoice provides more information for your customers. You can also use them to stay organized, evaluate sales, and calculate annual reports. If you end up with an insurance claim on the shipment, the main supporting document for the claim is the commercial invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial invoices make things easier for you, your customers, couriers, and border authorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2540\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8297362-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>What should a commercial invoice include?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The template for your commercial invoice might vary but it should always include the following required information:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Date of export<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Put the date you send out your shipment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Exporter or shipper<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The sender is the one exporting, and all of their details must be included, such as company name, street address, contact name, phone number, email address, and the country being shipped from.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consignee<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The recipient is the one who receives the package, and their information should include their company name, street address, contact name, phone number, email address, and the country being shipped to.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Country of origin<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Put the country the item or goods came from.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shipping number<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This number comes from your carrier, such as FedEx or UPS.
