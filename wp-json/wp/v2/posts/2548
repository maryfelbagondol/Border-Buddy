This is because each country has different regulations surrounding customs duties and taxes. The amount you owe can change depending on which products you\u2019re importing, where the products were made, and the shipping method you\u2019ve chosen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, you can estimate how much you\u2019ll pay in duties and taxes with our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.borderbuddy.com\/calculator2\/public\/import?_ga=2.141801010.1457704834.1636739513-1166962292.1636482455\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free customs duty calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether you\u2019re importing to Canada or the US, you\u2019ll be able to develop a proper budget for your import-export business with this duties and taxes calculator.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>When to use the customs duty calculator<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our customs duty calculator was created with you in mind. You can use it for your import-export business or your individual international shipments. It\u2019s incredibly easy to use and takes just a few minutes to gather the necessary information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re new to the import-export world, you might not be familiar with the complex tax and duty requirements. Or perhaps you\u2019re a seasoned importer, but you\u2019re debating whether to begin importing a new product. Either way, you\u2019ll get a better idea of what you need to pay in duties and taxes with this calculator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/importing-cars-from-us-to-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">importing a car<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for personal use. In that case, you\u2019ll want to use this helpful tool to calculate how much you need to set aside for duty and tax payments. Keep in mind that some cars may have high customs duty requirements and may not be worth purchasing outside your country, even if the savings seem sizable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to answer each question<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our free duties and taxes calculator requires just a few minutes of your time because it only asks you 10 questions. If you want to import a vehicle, you can specify that in the first question. If not, select \u201cImport any item.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next question asks whether you\u2019ll be importing the product to Canada or the US. At this time, our customs duty calculator does not provide information about importing to other countries. You will need to research the duties and taxes for your specific country if it\u2019s not the US or Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After that, you\u2019ll be asked to specify which country you\u2019re importing from. This is the country where the goods are coming from, whether or not they were manufactured there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you enter the specific item you\u2019re importing, you can select the country where the goods are made. This may or may not be the same as the country you\u2019re importing from. For example, you might be shipping handbags from Germany to Canada that were manufactured in China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll need to enter the total value of the goods. You can choose whether to make this amount in USD or CAD. Keep in mind that the value of the goods needs to be accurate to properly calculate the taxes and duties. If you don\u2019t know the value of the goods, contact your supplier to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question that follows asks you whether the products are intended for individual or business use. If you\u2019re planning to resell the products, choose \u201cBusiness.\u201d If the products will be used by you and your family (i.e. a personal car), select \u201cIndividual.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would recommend you request a copy of the quote so you can look back on it whenever you need to. After specifying whether you\u2019ve purchased the product yet, you just have one question left to answer. This one is about whether you\u2019re planning to ship by ocean or air. If you haven\u2019t decided yet, learn more about which option is best for you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/shipping-across-the-pond-things-to-consider-when-shipping-outside-north-america\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve answered all of the questions, you will see a page that shows a list of all of the taxes and duties you will owe for your shipment. Of course, we can\u2019t guarantee that these are entirely accurate without knowing more about your specific situation, but this will give you a good estimate that you can base your budget on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2549\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dmitry-demidko-eBWzFKahEaU-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>What your results mean<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all of the abbreviations that stand for different taxes and duties, it can be confusing to figure out what they actually mean. First, you should know that the standard types of customs duties and taxes in Canada are quite different from those in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Canada, you\u2019ll typically be required to pay <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/whats-the-difference-between-gst-hst-and-pst\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goods and Services Tax (GST)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regardless of which items you\u2019re importing or where they come from. Canadian GST is 5% of the total value of your shipment. You will also need to pay a customs clearance fee that depends on your shipment\u2019s value as well as GST on the customs clearance fee. If the customs clearance fee is $150, for example, you\u2019ll have to pay an additional $7.50 as GST on this fee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to US customs duties and taxes, things get a little bit more complicated. Unlike Canada, the US does not have a national tax that is imposed on imports. Rather, there are a bunch of duties that are collected based on the items, their value, and their origin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The general customs duties are calculated based on the specific type of item you are shipping. You can get a more accurate estimate of customs duties when you know your product\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/american-tariff-basics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other import fees you may need to pay when shipping to the US include the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/american-tariff-basics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">merchandise processing fee (MPF) and the harbor maintenance fee (HMF)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The latter is only applicable when you ship via ocean freight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from these import fees, you will need to purchase a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/what-is-a-customs-bond\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customs bond<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when shipping to the US if your shipment is worth more than $2,500 (USD). You\u2019ll also pay a small customs bond underwriting fee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have other customs duties and taxes listed in your results, feel free to reach out to one of our experts with any questions.
