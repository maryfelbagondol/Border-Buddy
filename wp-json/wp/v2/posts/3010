Their bubbly, distinct look makes them a favourite for many, particularly older models. Our CEO, Graham Robins, is a car lover who also wants to do his part in innovating away from reliance on fossil fuels for driving. The challenge with original, vintage VW Beetles (or \u201cBugs\u201d) is that they aren\u2019t particularly fuel efficient &#8211; and certainly are not electric. Volkswagen has made a concerted effort to expand into electric vehicles, with a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volkswagen.co.uk\/en\/electric-and-hybrid\/electric-cars\/concept-cars\/e-bugster.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VW Beetle Concept Car<\/a>, along with other cherished VW models. The automotive industry is in a state of reckoning, if innovation isn\u2019t taken seriously when it comes to converting to electric.<\/p>\n<p>Not one to wait around, Graham is embarking on a DIY VW-electrification project, retrofitting his original 1955 bug to be fully electric.<\/p>\n<h2>Why electric? Why now?<\/h2>\n<p>Solely gas-powered vehicles are on the chopping block, with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/01\/the-u-s-just-announced-that-cars-will-have-to-be-a-lot-more-fuel-efficient-by-2026\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2030<\/a> as the cutoff date for when all new vehicles sold must be electric in the USA. This date has moved around some and varies in each country. The Canadian Government has announced that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrcan.gc.ca\/energy-efficiency\/transportation-alternative-fuels\/zero-emission-vehicle-infrastructure-program\/21876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all new vehicle sales will be electric by 2035<\/a>. This is fuelled (zing!) by concerns about climate change and emissions, which we\u2019ve all been feeling. The announcement\u2019s intention is aimed to make electric vehicles of all makes more affordable, and is a huge step forward for the electric car (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/next\/2022\/07\/23\/faster-cheaper-greener-are-drone-deliveries-the-future-of-logistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and freight<\/a>) industry.<\/p>\n<p>Cars have always been a big market, and importing and exporting cars into Canada is one of BorderBuddy\u2019s top specialties. According to Automotive Industries Association of Canada (AIA Canada) the Canadian automotive aftermarket was at C$38.8 billion\/US$29.14 billion of GDP in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The US light-duty automotive aftermarket is a $324 billion industry (2021) with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 4% projected through 2024. Light-duty is a subset of the entire aftermarket.* The entire US aftermarket, including light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles, is projected at nearly $420 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $477 billion in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>DIY &#8211; Follow Along &amp; Get Inspired<\/h2>\n<p>BorderBuddy CEO Graham Robins will be sharing video and images of his project, which we\u2019ll share with you on our social channels and of course, our blog.<\/p>\n<p>The first episode is slated for early Autumn 2022, with Graham sharing his vehicle history (spoiler: he\u2019s had this car since he was 14!) and why\u2026and how he\u2019s taking the wheel of this project, well before gasoline cars are not sold anymore.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a DIY dream of Graham\u2019s, and you may find yourself inspired.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t currently have a vintage VW Beetle that you\u2019d like to try and electrify? Well\u2026we\u2019re pretty good (1100+ delighted reviews don\u2019t lie!) at importing cars of all makes and models, so maybe you\u2019ll be inspired enough to join along.
