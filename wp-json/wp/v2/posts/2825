Chances are, moments later, some muddy but exhilarated dirt biker emerged from the woods, speckled with dirt and grinning from helmeted ear to ear. As more people look to the great outdoors to spend their leisure time \u2014 often closer to home than picking up the family and boarding a plane \u2014 now is the perfect time to find a new or used dirtbike to put some horsepower behind your adventures. One question you might have &#8211; are dirt bikes considered motor vehicles, like motorcycles? In short, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dirtbikeplanet.com\/are-dirt-bikes-legally-considered-motor-vehicles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">yes<\/a>, so they require similar licensing to own and operate as their choppier counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>In Canada, there are many fewer motorcycles and dirt bikes than in the U.S. \u2014 700K vs approx 13M. Thus, you have a much wider buying pool in the U.S. and may get a much better deal. Sadly, you can\u2019t just buy a vehicle in the U.S. and chuck it in your car, cross the border to Canada and be done with it.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, we can help. Choosing dirt bikes for you and your (mature, able to handle the equipment) friends or family is rewarding, exciting, and easier than ever. Consider the border disappeared, that\u2019s our promise to you. So don\u2019t feel discouraged if the motorbike of your dreams is in Idaho and you\u2019re in Nanaimo, B.C. We can get it to you.<\/p>\n<h3>Conformity with Laws<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re legally required to keep records proving evidence of conformity for at least 6 years post date of the manufacture. If the records are maintained on your behalf, by a third party (like BorderBuddy), you must keep a record of the name, address and information of the person who keeps those records. With us, it\u2019s part of our process.<\/p>\n<p>The Canadian government recommends making necessary arrangements in preparation for showing evidence of conformity with the laws within the timeframe laid out by the government. It is unlikely, but possible that these records will be requested by the Minister of the Environment.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure that your dirt bike\/off road motorcycle outlined in the conformity\/EPA certificate matches your product. It\u2019s a no brainer, but we err on the side of caution so that you don\u2019t get any surprises.<\/p>\n<h3>The Legalities of it all &#8211; Importing a Bike from the USA into Canada<\/h3>\n<p>As a country trying its hardest to preserve natural beauty and manage emission targets, it\u2019s not a surprise that Canada has stringent laws when it comes to importing exhaust creating (carbon emission generating) products, be they farm equipment or leisure craft, like dirt bikes.<\/p>\n<p>From the Government of Canada website:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c\u200b\u200bEmission standards for on-road motorcycles are governed under the On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations (regulations) established under the authority of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Your BorderBuddy expert will be able to answer any questions about duties and regulations. You can also try our <a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator\/amp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free calculator<\/a> to see what it will cost to bring or export your dirt bike.<\/p>\n<h3>Required Reading: What Is Considered an \u201cOn-Road Motorcycle\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>On-road motorcycles have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/environment-climate-change\/services\/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry\/importing-motorcycles-road-vehicle-regulations-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">defined for emission<\/a> purposes as on-road vehicles with a headlight, taillight and stoplight that have two or three wheels and a curb weight of 793 kilograms (kg) (1749 pounds) or less. Any motorcycle that can\u2019t exceed 40km (25mph for our non-metric buddies) on paved ground isn\u2019t seen as an \u201con-road vehicle\u201d. Simply put, any \u201cmotorcycle type\u201d vehicle not considered to be an on-road vehicle is recognized as an \u201coff-road recreational vehicle\u201d. They carry their own emission standards under the <a href=\"https:\/\/pollution-waste.canada.ca\/environmental-protection-registry\/regulations\/view?Id=85\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Marine Spark-Ignition Engine, Vessel and Off-Road Recreational Vehicle Emission Regulations<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Prior to Importation<\/h3>\n<p>In order to bring your dirtbike into Canada or the U.S., you must follow conformity regulations for the EPA\/Environment and Climate Change Canada. We\u2019ve copied a chart below to break it down, but if it makes you more confused than confident, you know who to call *ahem*. There is also this handy guideline specifically about <a href=\"https:\/\/pollution-waste.canada.ca\/environmental-protection-registry\/regulations\/view?Id=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emissions legislation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2839\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/border-buddy-img-17-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/border-buddy-img-17-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/border-buddy-img-17-1-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/border-buddy-img-17-1-768x386.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cycletrader.com\/New-Dirt-Bike\/motorcycles-for-sale?category=Dirt%20Bike%7C2001457&amp;condition=N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start browsing<\/a>!
