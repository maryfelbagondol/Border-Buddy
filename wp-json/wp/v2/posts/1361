There are also no known reports for other coronaviruses about infections due to food or contact with dry surfaces. Transmission via surfaces that have recently been contaminated with viruses is, nonetheless, possible through smear infections. However, this is only likely to occur during a short period after contamination, due to the relatively low stability of coronaviruses in the environment.<\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Can imported goods from regions where the disease has spread be sources of an infection in humans?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transmission methods recorded thus far, and the relatively low environmental stability of Coronaviruses, it is unlikely that imported goods such as imported foods or consumer goods and toys, tools, computers, clothes or shoes may be sources of an infection with the new type of coronavirus, according to the current state of knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What does the border closing mean?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent article in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/03\/19\/border-closing-or-no-us-canada-trade-likely-to-decline-136179\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Politico<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports that government officials promise that the closing of the U.S.-Canada border to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus won\u2019t affect trade between the two partners, but a slowdown may be inevitable as the two countries work out what business purposes should be deemed \u201cessential.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that deliveries of food, fuel, and medicines would continue under the agreement.

More than half of all the goods and services Canada imported in 2018 came from the United States. Every billion dollars worth of U.S. agricultural exports to Canada supports about 8,100 U.S. workers. Canada is the No. 1 agricultural-export customer for 30 U.S. states. Canada was the second-biggest direct investor in the U.S. in 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It cuts just as deep the other way: 90% of Canadian energy exports are consumed by Americans. Just over 75% of all Canadian merchandise exports are bought by Americans. The United States was the single largest foreign investor in Canada in 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As both countries struggle to contain the coronavirus, bear in mind that we sell one another vast amounts of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

Going forward it is probably best to diversify suppliers and not have all your needs being met by one factory. While we are all in a wait-and-see mode it is a good time to explore other manufacturing options, especially those that would bolster the economy here at home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Amazon<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is dependent on Amazon, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/03\/23\/amazon-prime-deliveries-delayed-up-to-a-month-amid-coronavirus\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported on March 23rd that A<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mazon Prime is taking as long as a month to deliver some items that usually arrive in two days as the coronavirus pandemic slams the e-commerce titan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Items such as NutriBullet blenders, computer cables and best-selling books would not be delivered until at least April 21 if ordered on Monday, Amazon listings showed.

It is important to get ahead of the problem and be proactive, rather than reactive to the crisis at hand.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>These are four important ways to strategize:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowering Risk. Do you have a backup plan? If you manufacture product overseas, you need to explore manufacturing locally. If you\u2019re selling internationally, are you selling to different markets or are you relying on one particular customer? Should currency fluctuate, do you have a strategy in place for foreign exchange?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk sharing. If you are focused solely on one product line you may want to branch out, so that if one side of your business takes a hit you have another business that is still healthy. Diversification is the answer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk reduction. Get the right professional help with your contracts. Allow for contingencies for working capital.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk transfer\/insurance. The biggest asset on your books is accounts receivable. Amira Dali, Senior Accounts Manager of EDC\u2019s Commercial Markets and Small Business advises, \u201cIf you\u2019re a company that\u2019s working with customizable goods, do you have contract cancellation insurance in case your contracts get canceled and you\u2019ve already incurred all those costs? If your goods are transported through the sea, do you have marine cargo insurance? Depending on the industry you\u2019re in, sometimes your contracts have letters of credit or bonding needs \u2013 performance bonds, advance payment bonds \u2013 are you protected? Do you have wrongful call insurance?\u201d <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>Protection from payment default<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk of non-payment as a result of Covid-19 is top of mind for many Canadian exporters. Dali says credit insurance is essential to protect your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out this link for more about the EDC\u2019s<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edc.ca\/en\/campaign\/coronavirus-covid-19.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Protecting your workplace<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1790 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/not-today-covid19-sign-on-wooden-stool-3952231-1-1-1024x866.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"594\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/not-today-covid19-sign-on-wooden-stool-3952231-1-1-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/not-today-covid19-sign-on-wooden-stool-3952231-1-1-300x254.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/not-today-covid19-sign-on-wooden-stool-3952231-1-1-768x650.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/not-today-covid19-sign-on-wooden-stool-3952231-1-1-1536x1299.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WHO offers these valuable guidelines for getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 on their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/docs\/default-source\/coronaviruse\/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=359a81e7_6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">site<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is critical to start doing these things now, even if the virus has not arrived in the communities where you operate. You can already reduce working days lost due to illness and stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 if it arrives at one of your workplaces. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your workplaces are clean and hygienic. Surfaces (e.g. desks and tables) and objects (e.g. telephones, keyboards) need to be wiped with disinfectant regularly. Why? Because contamination on surfaces touched by employees and customers is one of the main ways that COVID-19 spreads.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promote regular and thorough hand-washing by employees, contractors, and customers by putting sanitizing hand rub dispensers in prominent places around the workplace. Make sure these dispensers are regularly refilled and posters promoting hand-washing are on display \u2013 ask your local public health authority for these or look on www.WHO.int. Combine this with other communication measures such as offering guidance from occupational health and safety officers, briefings at meetings and information on the intranet to promote hand-washing. Make sure that staff, contractors and customers have access to places where they can wash their hands with soap and water. Why? Because washing kills the virus on your hands and prevents the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Promote good respiratory hygiene in the workplace. Display posters promoting respiratory hygiene. Combine this with other communication measures such as offering guidance from occupational health and safety officers, briefing at meetings and information on the internet, etc.\u00a0 Ensure that face masks and\/or paper tissues are available at your workplaces, for those who develop a runny nose or cough at work, along with closed bins for hygienically disposing of them. Why? Because good respiratory hygiene prevents the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Postpone all business trips unless it&#8217;s absolutely critical to the operation of the business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Brief your employees, contractors and customers that if COVID-19 starts spreading in your community anyone with even a mild cough or low-grade fever (37.3 C or more) needs to stay at home. Proactively, you can elect to send as many employees home to work remotely if possible to avoid interaction with other employees at this time. They should also stay home (or work from home) if they have had to take simple medications, such as paracetamol\/acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin, which may mask symptoms of infection. Keep communicating and promoting the message that people need to stay at home even if they have just mild symptoms of COVID-19. Display posters with this message in your workplaces. Combine this with other communication channels commonly used in your organization or business.\u00a0 Your occupational health services, local public health authority or other partners may have developed campaign materials to promote this message. Make clear to employees that they will be able to count this time off as sick leave.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>What is the government doing?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great way to aid in this war on the coronavirus while also making up for some lost revenue is putting your facility to use for the cause.
