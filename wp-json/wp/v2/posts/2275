Or maybe you think about texts you\u2019ve received telling you that you\u2019ve won a gift card or that your bank account is frozen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scams aren\u2019t limited to one-time emails, phone calls, or text messages. They aren\u2019t always easy to identify. Whenever you make any changes to your business, you need to be aware of any potential scams that could affect your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/8-tips-to-remember-when-expanding-your-business-to-international-shipping\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expanding your company to international shipping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there are several scams you could fall victim to if you\u2019re not careful. Here are the most common scams and what you can do to avoid them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Imposter freight companies<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every freight forwarding company is legitimate. Imposters are all over the internet, posing as more reputable freight companies or pretending to be earnest when they\u2019re actually looking to steal your money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever you\u2019re looking for a freight company to work with, make sure you vet all candidates thoroughly to make sure they\u2019re trustworthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to avoid this scam: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few strategies you can adopt to determine whether a freight forwarding company is legitimate:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check the company\u2019s URL to see if it is trying to imitate a well-known freight company or if it is part of a free web domain such as Wix or Hubspot. Real freight companies typically have their own domain.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read through the site and look for typos or content stolen from other sites.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evaluate the logo. If it is blurry or low-quality, chances are the company is meant to scam people.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do some research to make sure the freight company you\u2019re looking at is not the same as another more established company. If you search the company name and another company comes up, that\u2019s a big red flag.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>2. Fraudulent returns<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/22-year-old-allegedly-scammed-amazon-out-370k-return-shipments-filled-dirt-1452452\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one 22-year-old scammed Amazon out of $370,000<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. How did he do it? He would order an item, register it to be returned, and then send back a box filled with dirt that was the exact same weight as the item. He would receive the refund from Amazon and resell the unreturned item. What made this possible was Amazon\u2019s slowness to open the returned boxes and discover the dirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This probably doesn\u2019t happen all that often, but it\u2019s important to have policies in place to ensure your returns process remains effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to avoid this scam: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The returns process becomes a little more complicated once you expand to international shipping. Make sure you create a returns policy that puts your customers first but also lowers the risk of fraud. Specify that an item must be in excellent condition to be returned. Factor in company time for processing returns quickly and efficiently. Remember, customers value a simple returns process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2270\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/pexels-jessica-bryant-1370704-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Fake addresses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, scammers will use a fake international address to trick you. If you\u2019re not careful, you could face charges of fraud for shipping your products to this fake address.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be on the lookout if your customer inputs a shipping address and then asks you to ship the product to an address in another country. While this is not always fraud, it could be a scam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to avoid this scam: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check every international address to make sure it\u2019s authentic. If you have any questions about an address, ask your customer. Most of the time, your customers are trustworthy people who want to give your products a try.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Counterfeit customs fees charges<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this may not affect you directly as a seller, your customers might suffer from counterfeit customs fees charges. It\u2019s often necessary for international buyers to pay customs fees to the country they live in. The problem comes when a scammer asks for customs fees to be paid via PayPal, Venmo, or money order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical way to be notified of customs fees is to receive a notice from the customs office in the country you\u2019re in. If you\u2019re asked to pay the customs fee online, you will go to the customs office\u2019s official website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to avoid this scam: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although your company may not be directly impacted by this scam, you may receive customer complaints if this happens to them when they order your products. It\u2019s best to put a notice on your website that informs your customers how and when they\u2019ll pay customs fees. Whenever you have a customer from a country you don\u2019t usually ship to, make sure the customer is aware of that country\u2019s policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Denying Bill of Lading<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fake freight companies will conduct business in a way that seems normal&#8230;until your goods are loaded at the port. Then, the scammers will refuse to give you a Bill of Lading (BOL), which is an important document that proves the goods have been received. Without a BOL, no one will be able to claim the shipment at the port of destination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to get the BOL, you will be asked to pay a specific amount of money to the scammer or risk losing your shipment entirely. Trustworthy freight companies will provide you with a BOL without extra fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to avoid this scam: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake freight companies will often offer to ship your goods at an incredibly low rate. Don\u2019t be tempted by this \u201cbargain\u201d&#8230;you\u2019ll make up for it in costly fees later on. Before you decide on a freight forwarder, have a proper idea of what your shipment should cost. That way, you won\u2019t be sucked into a scam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking for someone to help your business with importing and exporting?
