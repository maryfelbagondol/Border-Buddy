Australia<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on January 1, 2005. The agreement eliminated tariffs on more than 99% of qualifying manufactured goods exported to Australia. It also opened up markets for certain service goods, like life insurance. There are better intellectual property rules in place thanks to this agreement. US farm exports also have duty-free treatment, including processed foods, fruits, vegetables, corn, and soybeans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for free trade solutions between Canada and Australia?

Bahrain<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States-Bahrain FTA took effect in 2006. It has allowed the free flow of industrial and consumer goods between the two countries, without tariffs. US farmers have increased exports to Bahrain and Bahrain has opened up its markets to service providers. Since the implementation of the FTA, US exports to Bahrain have gone up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/countries-regions\/europe-middle-east\/middle-east\/north-africa\/bahrain\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">301%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with top export categories being aircraft, machinery, vehicles, and electrical machinery.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. USMCA<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USCMA) effectively replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as of July 1, 2020. It covers many areas of trade and foreign investment between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Almost all goods shipped between the three countries are eligible for duty-free treatment. It also bolstered intellectual property and copyright requirements and required each country to raise their de minimis rates (which allows goods of higher value to pass through borders tax-free). The USCMA agreement was the first time in decades that Canada agreed to raise its de minimis rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you a Canadian business looking for a list of Canada\u2019s free trade agreements?

Israel<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement is the oldest FTA currently in force for the US. Since the agreement first took effect in 1985, US exports to Israel have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/trade-agreements\/free-trade-agreements\/israel-fta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risen by 456%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
