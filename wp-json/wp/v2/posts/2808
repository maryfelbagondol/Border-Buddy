We can offer you the next best thing, which is an ongoing high level navigation guide to the ever changing circumstances affecting global trade, with a focus on importing and exporting.<\/p>\n<p>At a 30,000 foot view, we see the ongoing crisis in Ukraine causing gas prices to skyrocket and inflation rates to creep upwards as uncertainty continues. Russia\u2019s chokehold on surrounding nations with natural gas and oil is causing ripple effects on the global economy, most certainly affecting prices for shipping anything across any borders. For reference, Russia produces about 11% of the world\u2019s oil. Our BorderBuddy agents are closely monitoring headlines and industry chatter, and are as always, committed to finding you the best routes and methodologies for your importing and exporting, no matter the size of your business.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2813 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/border-buddy-img-10-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/border-buddy-img-10-1.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/border-buddy-img-10-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/border-buddy-img-10-1-768x511.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-61235528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BBC<\/a>, oil prices are expected to stay elevated into 2024, which will lead to widespread inflation. Disruptions from the war are expected to have a lasting negative effect, with sanctions on foreign companies and reduced technology creating snarls across the world.<\/p>\n<h3>China: lockdowns and uncertainty<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6168543\/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/time.com\/6168543\/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously, China is in partial lockdown courtesy of its aggressive COVID-Zero policy, which is shaking the already fragile global supply chain. According to economics and trade policy professor, Eswar Prasad of Cornell University and former head of the IMF\u2019s China Division, \u201cThe already extensive <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6168543\/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disruptions to global supply chains are being exacerbated<\/a> by the lockdowns in China, adding to inflationary pressures and difficulties in procuring a broad range of consumer goods.\u201d The restrictions put into place as part of COVID-Zero amplify ongoing supply disruptions by affecting the country\u2019s industrial production and export activity. Simply put by a top Hauwei executive, China\u2019s COVID-zero policy might trigger \u201cmassive losses&#8221; and directly impact the global supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/chinas-export-growth-beats-expectations-imports-slip-2022-04-13\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters<\/a>, China&#8217;s imports unexpectedly fell in March due to the COVID-19 restrictions across large parts of the country. The lockdowns delayed the arrival of freight shipments while domestic demand shrunk, and overall export growth slowed down. Analysts anticipate a worsening in trade in the second fiscal quarter.<\/p>\n<h3>What does this mean to me?<\/h3>\n<p>On a macro level, the world is in a state of much upheaval and uncertainty. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed, and we get it. Our BorderBuddy agents are people just like you, witnessing the same disruptions.
