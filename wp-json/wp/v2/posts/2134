There\u2019s no denying how important digital products and services are to Canadian businesses and consumers. In late 2019, e-Commerce retail trade sales added up to almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/2728\/e-commerce-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.85 billion (CAD)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and approximately 28.1 million Canadians made purchases online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digital goods and services fall under different tax categories than physical goods, so when selling digital products to consumers in Canada it\u2019s best to ensure you\u2019re applying the right tax. In the same vein, Canadian businesses exporting digital products overseas must comply with tax laws of the countries where their customers live.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Non-resident importers who supply digital products and services<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under Canada\u2019s current rules, non-resident importers (NRIs) who sell digital products and services to customers in Canada do not have to register for the goods and services tax (GST) or harmonized sales tax (HST). HST is usually a combination of the GST and a provincial sales tax (PST), but not all provinces have a PST on digital goods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NRIs are responsible for customs declaration and calculating taxes and duties. You can include all the shipping, customs clearances, duties, and taxes in the shipping and handling fees or in the price of your digital products. This way your Canadian customers pay it. Consumers in Canada are supposed to self-assess the appropriate GST\/HST on digital services purchased from NRIs and remit the tax to the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/the-benefits-of-becoming-a-non-resident-importer-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how to become a non-resident importer in Canada to learn what your responsibilities are when importing digital products to Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What counts as digital products or services?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to sell digital products and services as an NRI in Canada, then you should understand what\u2019s considered a digital product and what is not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, anything a customer receives or accesses over the Internet is a digital product. If the customer gets an email, downloads a file, or logs into a service portal after purchasing, then it\u2019s a digital product or service. If a customer orders something online and it\u2019s shipped to them via snail mail, that is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a digital product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Canada, digital products may also be referred to as a digital good, digital service, electronic good, electronic service, incorporeal moveable property, or intangible personal property. Examples of these products are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downloads or streaming services for music, games, films, or other media<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software, apps, or SaaS subscriptions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ebooks and some newspaper or magazine subscriptions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">App hosting and data warehousing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telecommunications services<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2135\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-freestocksorg-987586-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses with a physical presence in Canada that provide digital goods must pay the federal GST, as well as PST if applicable. For now, NRIs do not have to pay the federal GST or PST, except for in the provinces of Quebec (QST), Saskatechwan, and British Columbia. But this tax structure will soon change for NRIs\u2026.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Canada\u2019s new tax affects foreign suppliers of digital goods and services<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of 2020, Canada announced a reform of its GST\/HST structure that will require non-resident importers of digital products and services to register for the GST\/HST and pay the same tax to the CRA that resident suppliers pay. Any foreign company that exceeds an annual threshold of $30,000 (CAD) will have to register.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax will impact:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-border digital products and services (such as mobile apps and movie\/music streaming services)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goods supplied through Canadian fulfillment warehouses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short-term accommodation through digital platforms (e.g. Airbnb)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of tax model was recently put into place in the provinces of Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, but as of July 2021, it will be in effect for all of Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Leveling the playing field<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why did the Canadian government propose these new tax rules? A report from the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oag-bvg.gc.ca\/internet\/English\/parl_oag_201905_03_e_43340.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the government lost $169 million (CAD) in revenue to uncollected GST on digital services supplied by foreign companies. Asking consumers to self-assess and remit the tax to the CRA isn\u2019t a reliable method for collecting the taxes owed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada\u2019s new tax model was also partially in response to a U.S. Supreme Court case involving the online retailer Wayfair. This case ruled U.S. states could apply state sales tax to goods being sold within their state, even if the supplier didn\u2019t have a physical presence there. Canada\u2019s nationwide application of GST\/HST to foreign digital service providers and retailers helps level the playing field.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What the new GST\/HST rule means for foreign digital service providers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreign digital products suppliers won\u2019t have to charge GST\/HST to individuals or companies who are already registered, but they will have to collect it from those who are not registered. To determine if a customer must pay GST\/HST, foreign importers will have to gather information about customers\u2019 residence so they can determine if the GST\/HST applies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Do Canadian exporters pay digital services taxes?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada-based businesses exporting digital products internationally typically must pay a digital service tax. Many countries have revised their VAT\/GST rules so that Canadian businesses exporting their digital products and services must pay a tax on sales of digital services to customers in those countries. Currently, there are more than 60 countries or territories that charge some sort of value added or general service tax on digital goods. Countries that added a digital services tax in 2020 and 2021 include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tajikistan<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paraguay<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vietnam<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costa Rica<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecuador<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indonesia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chile<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mexico<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moldova<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Singapore<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malaysia<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uzbekistan<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zimbabwe<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameroon<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algeria<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian businesses looking to offer their digital products and platforms abroad should be aware of the duties and tax responsibilities of the country they\u2019re selling to. If your business doesn\u2019t register for the foreign government\u2019s appropriate tax regime in time, you could face penalties after you\u2019ve started selling your digital products there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding taxes on digital services in Canada is complicated enough.
