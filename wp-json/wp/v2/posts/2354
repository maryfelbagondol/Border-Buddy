You\u2019ll have many of the same import and export concerns, but there are several shipping considerations to take into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at 6 things to consider related to the factors that impact your shipments leaving North America.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Create an export plan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever you ship internationally, your business should have an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/7-tips-for-establishing-your-export-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">export plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In your plan, you should include the following:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Export potential<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Do your products have the potential to do well outside your home country? If your products turn a profit at home, they can likely do so in other countries with similar market conditions. But cultures are different.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Market research<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Is your target destination country a good market for your products? Does your home country have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free trade agreement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FTA) with the country you are selling to?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Export licenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Businesses in the US rarely need an export license but Canadian companies must get a Business Number (BN) for importing and exporting. Also, check the list of restricted or prohibited imports for the country you\u2019re shipping to. Trying to ship restricted items could be a costly mistake.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Understand the language barrier<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Since English is a recognized international shipping language, you typically won\u2019t have to fill out a customs declaration in another language. For marketing your products to a foreign country, however, take the language barrier into account.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Helpful resources for your export plan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada Post has a helpful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost-postescanada.ca\/tools\/pg\/manual\/pgIntDest-e.asp?letter=A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that lets you see import restrictions and rules to every country or territory you can ship to from Canada. UPS has a similar tool, called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wwwapps.ups.com\/tradeability\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TradeAbility<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which lets you estimate the costs of shipping from any country in the world to another, find harmonized tariff codes, and detect export licenses. Working with a certified <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customs broker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can also make the customs clearance process go more smoothly when you ship your products outside North America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2352\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Choose between air freight and ocean freight<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When shipping outside North America, you\u2019ll have to use air freight or ocean freight to move your goods. Both have advantages and disadvantages which you should consider carefully before choosing one or the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Shipping by air is faster than by sea<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the size of your shipment, air delivery could take between 3-9 days from Canada or the US to Europe. Sending shipments by air to China from North America takes between 6-13 days. Sea freight, on the other hand, takes much longer. Shipping by sea can take up to 30 days from North America to Europe and 45 days or more to Asia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Shipping by sea is cheaper than by air<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air delivery may be faster but it\u2019s more expensive. Prices vary depending on the shipping service you choose and how much you\u2019re sending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll have to decide which option is better for your business: air freight or ocean freight. Do you have the budget for the more expensive air shipping option or can you afford longer shipping times?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Allow longer delivery times<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter which method of shipment you choose, your delivery times will always be longer when shipping outside North America. This may seem obvious, but many businesses forget to factor long delivery times into their export plan. How much longer can your customers realistically expect to wait?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sending between the US and Canada may take anywhere from 1 business day to 2 weeks, depending on what you\u2019re shipping and how much you pay. When shipping outside North America, your delivery times could range from 3 business days to six weeks or more. Your shipping service can give you a more accurate estimate and remember, the faster the delivery the higher the cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Avoid shipping scams<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/5-scams-to-avoid-when-expanding-to-international-shipping\/\">Scams<\/a> happen all the time in international shipping and the less careful you are the more likely it is you\u2019ll encounter one. When you\u2019re expanding your business into shipping overseas, look out for the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake freight companies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fraudulent returns of products by customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shipping to fake international addresses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counterfeit customs fee notices<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only providing a Bill of Lading (BOL) if you pay a fee<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Get shipping insurance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any time you import or export goods, you should have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-breakdown-of-international-insurance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shipping insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When you ship outside North America, your shipment is en route longer and there are more chances of damage along the way.
