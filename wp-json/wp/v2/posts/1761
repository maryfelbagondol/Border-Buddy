Whether you are considering a brick and mortar shop or a strictly online business, you can use platforms like Amazon, Shopify, and so many others to get your product exposure and build up a business, and judging by the statistics, apparel is a great business to be in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve thought about importing apparel and textiles into Canada, you will need an understanding of the process, including what regulations must be followed and, of course&#8211;as with anything involving importing and exporting&#8211;know your acronyms!\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>An overview of regulations:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All garments imported into Canada have specific labeling requirements. Some textiles can be imported under Tariff Preference Level (TPL) at a reduced rate of duty.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What is TPL?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tariff Preference Level allows for specific quantities of certain yarns, fabrics, apparel, and textile articles traded among parties in certain free trade arrangements as a preferential tariff rate so long as they meet the modified FTA rules of origin under the agreement. Under TPL most rates of duty will be reduced.

If you are acting as the Importer of Record, you are responsible for the completion and accuracy of the import declaration, and you must pay the applicable taxes and duties to the government.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How much are taxes and duties?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rate of duty is determined by the tariff of the commodity being imported, the value of the goods, and the origin of the goods.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a general rule, with a few exceptions, fabrics are duty-free. Clothing is usually dutiable at 17% or 18%, but most baby clothing is duty-free. In addition, it is possible to avoid paying customs duties for clothing if certain conditions are met.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The &#8220;tax payable when importing goods&#8221; refers to GST, excise tax, and excise duty (which may or may not apply to the goods you wish to import). Note that for imported goods you only pay the federal portion (GST) of taxes even if you reside in a province that charges HST.

Additional fees may be levied by the government for these services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should you ever be audited by customs, you need to keep your import records for 6 years following the date of import.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What is the difference between the country of origin, country of acquisition, and shipping country?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>country of origin<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the country where the goods were actually manufactured and\/or produced, or where the last substantial transformation occurred, regardless of where it was purchased or from where it was exported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>country of acquisition<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is considered the country where the goods were when they were acquired by the importer to be exported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>shipping country<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is where the merchandise was at the time of its acquisition and from where it left to the final destination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, the country of origin is where the merchandise was manufactured, the country of acquisition is where the goods were purchased and the shipping country is where the goods went to their destination independent of the point of shipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What are the labeling requirements for garments sold in Canada?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All garments sold in Canada must have the following information appearing on the label:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English and French labeling\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">List fiber content\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appears in Dealer identity (CA#)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>How must the garment label be formatted in Canada?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The garment label must:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appear on disclosure label<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be able to withstand 10 washings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be accurate if size and care instructions are used (this particular information itself is not mandatory but if disclosed must be accurate)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Are some goods used in apparel restricted from import into Canada?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes.
