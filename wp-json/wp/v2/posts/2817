What better way to explore than on a bicycle? Zero emissions, zero dollars spent on gasoline, a great workout and much easier to park. Cheaper, too!<\/p>\n<p>But getting that perfect two wheeled companion takes a bit of work, especially if you\u2019re looking for any sort of specialty bike.

For small orders like a bike or bike parts, we have a simple, streamlined process that takes care of any paperwork and border duties so you don\u2019t have to. By browsing a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bikeforums.net\/general-cycling-discussion\/1182556-shipping-canada-us.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bike forums<\/a>, it\u2019s easy to see that many would-be bike owners have found themselves in love with a bike they\u2019ve seen on their travels or even found online, but are flummoxed at how to get their hands on it whilst staying abreast of the requisite duties. That\u2019s where our <a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator\/amp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calculator<\/a> comes in handy!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start browsing, shall we? Here are some sites that we love to visit and \u201cwindow-shop\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Buy from Private Sellers<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of places where you can buy bikes also have their own shipping schemas built in, which sometimes works in your favor, sometimes doesn\u2019t. Please note that while we\u2019d love to be your partner in importing or exporting your bike, our bottom line is making sure you\u2019re happy and satisfied, so consider us a resource for you as you make your buying and\/or selling decisions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/features\/how-to-buy-a-used-or-second-hand-bike-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bike Radar<\/a> is a terrific, unbiased resource for anyone looking to buy a used bike and what pitfalls to watch out for. We recommend giving them a few clicks as they are knowledge leaders in their space and their passion lies in satisfying would-be bike enthusiasts.<\/p>\n<h3>Taxation and Importing Bicycles into Canada<\/h3>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href=\"https:\/\/terminalcityriders.ca\/articles\/importing-bikes-and-parts-to-canada\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bringing whole bikes VS bike parts into Canada carry different taxation laws<\/a> and fee rates. For instance, a complete bike falls under customs tariff #8712.00.00, which has a 13% tax rate PLUS GST\/HST, which can add up. However this rate only applies to \u201ccomplete&#8221; bikes. Subcategories are then based on wheel size. If the bike you want to import has no wheels, it\u2019s not recognized as a complete bike. Thus, you can avoid the 13% tax rate and pay 6.5% if you get a bike without wheels. You can have the wheels shipped separately, or not at all.<\/p>\n<p>If you just want the hub, ask the seller to solely send the hub. You\u2019ll not only avoid 6.5% duty, but the package will be much smaller, and so will the shipping costs.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding Bikes to Browse<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bikeexchange.com\/s\/road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bike Exchange<\/a> is a mega website with every kind of bike and part you could need.
