Most recently, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/06\/27\/business\/russia-gold-import-ban-g7-intl-hnk\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ban on Russian gold was announced by the G7 nations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Via CNN, Russian gold is the country\u2019s second most valuable export after energy (oil), with gold exports at $15.5B in USD in 2021, based on intel from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/06\/27\/business\/russia-gold-import-ban-g7-intl-hnk\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UK government<\/a>. You don\u2019t have to worry about the bans, however. You may love gold and buy lots of it, but unless you\u2019re importing it, your love for gold jewelry won\u2019t be impacted by any bans.<\/p>\n<h3>But why the ban?<\/h3>\n<p>As we wrote recently, bans have been used against Russia (and other nations during times of war\/political upheaval) before. Most recently, Russian oil was banned by the G7 nations, and there are likely to be much greater global repercussions to oil than to gold. Banning is just one tactic in trying to get a nation to comply when other democratic routes are unsuccessful. History will tell us how effective these bans are. Until then\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Will a ban on Russian gold impact me?<\/h3>\n<p>In a word, no. If you\u2019re simply a lover of fine jewelry and your importing of gold is limited to a beautiful watch or necklace from a bygone era, you won\u2019t be pinched. In fact, there is debate on how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/world-nation\/story\/2022-06-28\/g7-ban-russian-gold-ukraine-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">much a ban on Russian gold will actually do<\/a>, beyond being more of a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/06\/27\/business\/russia-gold-import-ban-g7-intl-hnk\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">symbolic gesture<\/a>\u201d. Intended to further limit Russia\u2019s military power, the gold being banned is used for bullions. Gold would include various forms of gold like coins, bars and other forms of the metal. When you talk of bullion, it also includes other precious metals like silver and platinum. So, when we say trading in the commodity market, it would also include other precious metals. Gold for jewelry is categorized differently. The principal buyers of gold from Russian miners were Russian commercial banks, who sold to the Russian central bank or exported it. \u200b\u200bMore from Reuters on it, &#8220;[Russia&#8217;s] gold exports have already been rerouted since the start of the war, flowing eastwards rather than westwards, reflecting self-sanctioning from Western world gold market participants,&#8221; said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. &#8220;The implications of a ban on the gold market are likely very limited,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>So, there you have it! As a consumer or casual importer, you won\u2019t feel the impact of the ban on Russian gold in quite the same acute way that the Russian gold ban is probably hitting you and your family.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re planning on making a run at becoming a decentralized central bank for gold bullion, you don\u2019t need to stop browsing for your favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/romanovrussia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Romanov Era earrings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2968\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/border-buddy-img-35-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/border-buddy-img-35-1.jpeg 520w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/border-buddy-img-35-1-294x300.jpeg 294w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/border-buddy-img-35-1-65x65.jpeg 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Russian Gold Ban: Bullions, maybe, but no one\u2019s worrying about your bracelets.
