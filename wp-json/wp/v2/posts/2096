It can be especially difficult if you are a non-Canadian doing business in Canada. The system of GST, HST, and PST is unique to Canada. It differs from both European VAT and American sales tax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a non-resident doing business in Canada, you\u2019re still held responsible for initially paying the proper import tax. You need to know how to get reimbursed so you can pass the import tax on to your final customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a non resident importer in Canada is the first step to being able to pay taxes and run your import-export business efficiently. Click <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/the-benefits-of-becoming-a-non-resident-importer-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find out how.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to be well-informed about Canadian sales taxes because they influence your prices, the customs process, and the overall success of your business. Once you understand the differences between GST, HST, and PST, you\u2019ll be ready to tackle the Canadian import-export market.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>An Overview of GST, PST, and HST<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Canadian sales tax system has both federal and provincial components. The best way to think of it is to consider which tax applies in which province.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Goods and Services Tax (GST)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a 5% value-added tax levied by the federal government. It is placed on almost all goods and services. This tax applies to the entire country, but some provinces use it as their sole sales tax. The provinces that only have GST are Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. That means these provinces charge a 5% sales tax on most goods and services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Provincial Sales Tax (PST) <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a tax levied by certain provinces in addition to GST. The tax amount varies by province. The provinces that have PST are British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. British Columbia and Manitoba both have a 7% PST, so the total sales tax combined with GST is 12% in those provinces. Quebec has a 9.975% PST, resulting in a 14.975% total sales tax. Saskatchewan has a 6% PST, so the total sales tax combined with GST is 11%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a combination of GST and PST that exists in some provinces. The goal is to make it easier to collect sales tax by only collecting one tax. The provinces with HST are New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island. All of these provinces charge a 15% HST except Ontario, which charges a 13% HST.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2098\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"gst-hst-pst-what-are-the-differences\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-obsahovka-obsahovka-4449785-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Registering for GST, HST, and PST<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who pays these taxes? Typically, it\u2019s the end customer who is required to pay the applicable taxes. Even if you\u2019re a non-resident importer doing business in Canada, if you\u2019re making more than $30,000 per year, you must register for the GST\/HST and charge it to your customers. Find the registration process <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-gst-for-small-businesses-in-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on which provinces you sell your products in, you may need to register for PST as well. This will be done with each individual province you conduct business in. For example, if you sell your products to residents of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario, you need to register for the GST\/HST with the Canada Revenue Agency as well as the PST with the respective provincial governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan separately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that once you register for GST, you are automatically registered for HST as well. Even if you are considered a small supplier (making less than $30,000 per year), you may elect to register for GST\/HST because you can receive reimbursements for the GST you pay on imports. It is recommended to register your business for GST\/HST if you intend to make more than two shipments as the importer of record.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How GST Affects Imports<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another confusing aspect of GST is the different situations in which it is applied. We\u2019ve discussed how GST applies to most goods and services within Canada. What you might not know is that GST also applies to imports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever you import a shipment to Canada, you will be charged a 5% GST based on the total value of your shipment. If you import to a province with HST, you will only need to pay the 5% GST. This is in addition to any customs duties you may be required to pay. For an overview of the free trade agreements Canada has with other nations and corresponding tariff reductions, click <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to paying a 5% GST on the value of your shipment, you will be required to pay a 5% GST on the customs clearance fee that is charged based on the value of your goods. For example, if your customs clearance fee is $200 you\u2019ll have to pay an additional 5% GST, so you\u2019ll pay an extra $10.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of our free <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.borderbuddy.com\/calculator2\/public\/import?_ga=2.21177790.466356576.1612878678-178661728.1610552693\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada customs fees calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get an idea of the customs duties and fees for your shipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2097\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/christin-hume-Hcfwew744z4-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to Get Reimbursed for GST Paid on Imports<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a non-resident importer registered for GST\/HST, you may be able to get reimbursed for the GST you pay on imports. In order to do this, you must claim an input tax credit (ITC) on your GST\/HST return. You can also get reimbursement for GST you pay on goods that are exported back to the US for whatever reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a non-resident importer who has not registered for GST\/HST, you may still be able to receive reimbursement for the GST you pay on imports. To do this, you must have a Canadian purchaser who is GST\/HST registered. You need to provide your importation documentation to your Canadian purchaser, who can then claim an ITC on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>The US Sales Tax System<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are importing goods to the US, you may be curious to know about the US sales tax system. Unlike Canada\u2019s GST, the US does not have a federal sales tax. Instead, the US has state sales taxes. These do not apply to imports, however.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When importing into the US, you will be required to pay duties that range from 0% to 37%. The average duty rate is about 6%. If your country is part of a free trade agreement with the US, you may be exempt from customs duties. Businesses are entitled to duty and tax exemptions for shipments valued at less than $800 (USD) when shipping from Canada to the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still feeling a little overwhelmed by the prospect of calculating Canadian import tax?
