Global interconnectivity has made importing and exporting much more accessible than it once was&#8230;but there are still parts of it that can be challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main obstacle import-export businesses face is the customs clearance process. Due to the constantly changing rules that need to be followed, the various taxes and duties to be paid, and the mounds of paperwork to be submitted, customs proceedings require a certain kind of expertise. That\u2019s why many businesses involved in importing or exporting elect to hire a customs broker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there are some businesses who choose to wade through the sea of regulations on their own. Most businesses will decide to invest in a customs broker because they don\u2019t have the time or resources to make sure everything is done properly. It\u2019s usually much simpler to find a customs broker to deal with the customs details so you can focus on growing your revenue and sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a long list of benefits to hiring a customs broker, some of which you may not be aware of. Take a look and determine whether it\u2019s worth it for you to hire a customs broker for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Convenience<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the main difference between hiring an accountant to do your taxes and doing it yourself? It\u2019s more convenient to pay the accountant&#8230;and more likely that you won\u2019t have any issues with the IRS later on. When you choose to pay someone for a task that you could do yourself (albeit without the relevant expertise), you\u2019re placing a higher value on your time and energy. With the customs process, you can theoretically do everything by yourself, but it will take a lot of time and energy that you probably don\u2019t have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think that the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other free trade agreements<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would make going through customs a piece of cake. That\u2019s actually not the case. While these trade agreements certainly make things easier, there are still lots of regulations to follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2164\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4041392-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Safety<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine you\u2019re importing skincare products from Korea to the US. You carefully put together all of the required paperwork, but you accidentally misclassify the goods. Soon, you get hit with a $20,000 fine for committing customs fraud. Yikes! This costly mistake could have been avoided if you had hired a customs broker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a customs broker who is responsible for all things customs significantly lowers the risks. After obtaining <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-breakdown-of-international-insurance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">import-export insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, relying on a customs broker is doubtless the safest choice you can make for your company. It\u2019s difficult for a business to bounce back after being charged with fraud and paying the subsequent fines.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Adaptability<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International regulations change all the time, and COVID-19 has made things even more unpredictable. Customs brokers are uniquely positioned to stay up-to-date on the latest rules and regulations. They are experts in the field, after all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is in it for the long haul, a customs broker is a necessity. It\u2019s pointless to spend time and money learning the import regulations for a particular country only to have the rules change the following year. Having a regular customs broker gives your business the adaptability required to operate on a global scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wondering which other situations require a customs broker?

Paperwork assistance<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing more daunting than staring at a stack of important paperwork you don\u2019t know how to complete. Because documentation is so crucial to the customs process, it\u2019s best handled by experts. Unfortunately, one small mistake could cost you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hire a customs broker, they have your company\u2019s interests in mind. They are ready to advocate for you every step of the way. That\u2019s more than you can say for the average customs officer who doesn\u2019t really care whether your shipments get delayed or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2165\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/nicolas-j-leclercq-3-ZA5uSvJd0-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Cost management<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason companies choose not to hire a customs broker is the brokerage fees. That\u2019s a rather shortsighted view of profitability. Don\u2019t think of hiring a customs broker as a cost\u2013consider it an investment in the future of your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond helping you avoid costly charges due to customs fraud and other penalties, a customs broker is ideally situated to find the most affordable rates for your shipments and can help you budget properly. This helps you avoid any surprise fees along the way. If you\u2019re importing goods to Canada, your customs broker will often be able to assist you in getting back your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/whats-the-difference-between-gst-hst-and-pst\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid on imports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Efficiency<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine the sinking feeling that comes when you realize your shipment is stuck at the border. You receive numerous customer complaints reminding you that you\u2019ve broken your promises to them. You start calling customs several times a day trying to figure out where your goods are and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-to-get-your-stranded-us-shipments-back-to-canada\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how you can get them back<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This nightmare could easily be avoided with a customs broker on board.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t have your goods seized at the border, there\u2019s still the potential for huge delays that can affect your bottom line. The faster your shipments clear customs, the more profitable your business will become. Since customs brokers know the system better than anyone, they can navigate it more quickly and efficiently. They can even access automated customs clearance in some countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re ready to hire an experienced customs broker, look no further.
