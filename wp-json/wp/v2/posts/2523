Whether it\u2019s a huge package full of goods you\u2019re planning on selling commercially or a small gift for your great aunt, you\u2019ll probably want to consider the shipping rate changes that have occurred in 2021. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to be caught off guard at the post office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might think of national couriers like USPS and Canada Post as being primarily for domestic shipping. On the contrary, many people choose to use either USPS or Canada Post for international shipping because of their reliability and affordable prices. Of course, international shipping rates tend to be higher than domestic rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For import export business owners, going with one of these companies is a great choice because of their tracking options and professionalism. Both USPS and Canada Post even offer a special discount for commercial packages. They have ways to help you with customs clearance as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why did shipping rates change?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to blame everything on the Pandemic, but that\u2019s only one of the contributing factors to the shipping rate changes. In fact, COVID-19 is not even mentioned in either USPS\u2019s or Canada Post\u2019s explanation for the changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason shipping rates have changed is due to the huge decline in mail volume that has occurred over the last decade. This trend is expected to continue, with an estimated <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/faq.usps.com\/s\/article\/2021-Postage-Price-Changes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">36% decline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the year 2030.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of this decline probably doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to you. After all, people are accustomed to using technology to send documents and information they previously had to send by mail. With more and more communication platforms available and almost universal internet access, the return to relying on mail is probably not going to happen any time soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, this is likely only the first of many price increases to come in the next several years. As an importer or exporter, you\u2019ll want to keep a close eye on shipping rates so you don\u2019t get blindsided by future changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>USPS Shipping Rates 2021<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to choosing which USPS service to use for your package, there is an almost overwhelming number of options. The fastest international shipping option with tracking is called Global Express Guaranteed. It starts at $67.80 for a 0.5 lb package going to Canada. This service takes only 1-3 business days, with overnight delivery often possible to Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many importers and exporters choose the Priority Mail International Flat Rate option with tracking, which takes 6-10 business days but tends to be much more affordable. You don\u2019t have to pay more to ship heavier items, as long as they fit in the flat rate box and the total weight is under the specified amount. Small flat rate boxes (under 4 lbs) start at $29.55 for shipping to Canada, while large flat rate boxes (under 20 lbs) start at $71.05.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you\u2019re wondering how these prices were affected by the rate change that happened at the beginning of 2021, they increased by about 3%. Keep in mind that you may qualify for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usps.com\/business\/business-shipping.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discount<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you are a commercial retailer, particularly if you intend to regularly ship a high volume of packages. To get an estimate of how much you\u2019ll pay to ship your package, use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/postcalc.usps.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USPS\u2019s postage price calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2525\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-1024x819.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-300x240.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-768x614.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/livia-widjaja-N2EKGTgu5-k-unsplash-2048x1638.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Canada Post Shipping Rates 2021<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quickest way to send a package from Canada to the US is by using Canada Post\u2019s Priority Worldwide option. This allows your package to reach its destination by 10:30 AM the following day in most cases. It also gives you the ability to track your package and automatically charges the recipient for taxes and duties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more economical way to send your package is by choosing the Expedited Parcel option. It should take about 4-7 business days for your package to arrive. This option also includes tracking and hassle-free customs clearance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prices vary depending on package weight and destination. It\u2019s easy to price out different shipping options using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost-postescanada.ca\/information\/app\/far\/business\/findARate?execution=e1s1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada Post\u2019s rate comparison tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Remember that Canada Post offers various <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadapost-postescanada.ca\/cpc\/en\/business.page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discounts and solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for small and large businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Customs clearance assistance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that whenever you send a package to another country, it\u2019s considered exporting. That means relevant duties and taxes will apply. Fortunately, duties typically don\u2019t apply to packages sent between the US and Canada due to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-to-use-cusma-to-your-advantage\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, your packages will still be required to clear customs. This involves filling out customs forms and making tax payments. Taxes will typically be paid by the recipient of the package. If your package is detained by customs, you will usually be notified by your postal courier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wondering how much you\u2019ll owe in duties and taxes for the package you\u2019re importing?
