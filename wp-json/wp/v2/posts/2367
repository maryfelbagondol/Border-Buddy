In other ways, it feels like an entire year just vanished into the abyss. Although it\u2019s been over a year since the pandemic turned our world upside down, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the overall impact of COVID-19 on international trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one thing, the majority of economic activity during the pandemic has occurred domestically rather than internationally. Think about it for a second. People are spending most of their capital on healthcare, utilities, and housing, all of which tend to not have an international trade component. What does that mean for international trade?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some countries are highly vaccinated and recovering economically, others are battling new strains of the virus. So their economies are taking a hit. It\u2019s difficult to navigate the ever-changing winds of the world economy, especially as an importer or exporter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your import-export business still likely to be affected by COVID-19 even in 2021? There are several factors to consider that will help you make the best choices for your business moving forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The current state of the world economy<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, the overall state of the world economy is not nearly as bad as it was in spring 2020 when most countries were enforcing their strictest lockdown policies. In fact, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WEO\/Issues\/2021\/03\/23\/world-economic-outlook-april-2021\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World Economic Outlook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has reported a higher international economic growth projection for 2021 (6.0%) than it had in October 2020 for the same year (5.2%).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means things are looking good for the future of international trade, right? Well, there is still a lot of uncertainty, which is not conducive to the increased spending that catalyzes economic growth. With the potential for new Covid strains causing panic around the globe, people are hesitant to invest in nonessential products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that each country is experiencing a different speed of economic recovery. In the US, economic recovery is gaining momentum, and people are motivated to increase their spending due to the rollout of stimulus checks. Other countries that aren\u2019t faring so well in terms of economic recovery include Peru, Spain, and the Philippines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you\u2019re deciding how to move forward with your import-export business, consider the current economic situation of each of the countries in your supply chain. If you\u2019re planning on exporting to a country that isn\u2019t experiencing economic growth, you may need to change your strategy to focus on essential items. If you\u2019re thinking about importing to the US, now could be an opportune time to capitalize on the rising economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Shipping times and rising costs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While shipping times aren\u2019t as long as they were in the middle of the pandemic (remember how far in advance you had to order holiday gifts?), they\u2019re still <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshfruitportal.com\/news\/2021\/07\/13\/only-normalized-demand-will-solve-supply-chain-delays-wsc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much longer than they used to be<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some countries still have limits on the goods they can send and receive internationally. Overall, supply chain delays are becoming the norm.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, the cost of shipping containers is on the rise as well. Shipping a container costs <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fbx.freightos.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80% more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than it did in November 2020. Of course, this has significant implications for import-export businesses that bear the brunt of the increased costs and may subsequently need to raise their prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to succeed in this difficult climate, give yourself leeway when it comes to estimating the arrival time of your goods. Make sure you calculate shipping costs before pricing your products so you can know how much you need to charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2369\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/pexels-mehrad-vosoughi-3687999-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Which products are the best to import or export in a post-Covid world?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on 2020, it\u2019s easy to see which stocks you should have invested in. Zoom, Netflix, and Moderna all would have been great choices. But early on in the pandemic, most of us were stockpiling toilet paper instead of considering investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is another pivotal moment when you have the opportunity to think about which products will be most profitable to import or export in a post-Covid world. If you can get ahead of the game, your business could become very successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essential products always come out on top during a crisis. With an uncertain future still looming, people are continuing to stockpile essential items. Nonessential items, on the other hand, may remain on the back burner in many countries for some time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we\u2019ve learned anything from Covid, it\u2019s that e-commerce is the way to go. Brick-and-mortar stores are not making a huge comeback, even after lockdown restrictions are lifted. If you\u2019ve been considering a brick-and-mortar model for your import business, you may want to think about implementing a fully digitalized version instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working remotely doesn\u2019t seem to be going away anytime soon. That means IT products such as computers, tablets, and accessories are in high demand. Cars and gasoline, on the other hand, may see a decline due to this phenomenon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which product are you considering? If you have a unique product that suits your target market perfectly, chances are your business will be able to succeed regardless of what the future holds. Spend plenty of time brainstorming before jumping into a new line of products.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Which countries are the best to import or export to in a post-Covid world?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, it\u2019s difficult to determine which countries you should be importing or exporting to right now. Things are still unpredictable, particularly for countries that are struggling with economic recovery, vaccine rollout, and\/or new strains of the virus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by researching the current state of the economy in the country you\u2019re targeting. This will help you ascertain whether customers in that country will be able to afford your products.

The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-does-the-us-china-trade-war-affect-importers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US-China trade war<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is ongoing and continuing to impact importers and exporters around the world.

The best thing you can do is keep an eye on the world economy and the international trade climate to see how you can benefit from whatever shifts may come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking for someone to help your business with importing and exporting?
