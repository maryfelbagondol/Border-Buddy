With the global pandemic, supply chain changes, safety considerations, and economic hardships, it\u2019s a tough time to be in the import export business. All of these challenges have shifted concerns about the US-China trade war to the background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trade war began in 2018 as a result of President Trump\u2019s pledge to confront China\u2019s manufacturing dominance and increase American jobs. He used heightened tariffs and other tactics in an attempt to force China to accept a number of demands, including enhancing intellectual property protections. China fought back with retaliatory tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the full ramifications of the US-China trade war remain to be seen, it\u2019s clear that the economies of both countries have been influenced in significant ways. Of course, this leads to ordinary importers being enormously impacted by the trade war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re already an importer or you\u2019re thinking about starting your own import business, it\u2019s wise to consider how the trade war might affect your company. After all, no one knows when or if tariff rates will return to normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Is the US-China trade war still happening?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though most people think of the trade war as a distinctly Trump-era phenomenon, President Biden has not yet ended the trade tension. The Biden administration is examining the phase one trade deal but has made no move to lower the tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tariffs remain about at their peak, with US tariffs on Chinese goods at 19.3% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 20.7%. These tariffs are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.piie.com\/research\/piie-charts\/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exponentially higher<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than they were before the trade war began in 2018, when they were 3.1% and 8.0% respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems as though <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jonathanponciano\/2021\/03\/28\/trade-war-biden-administration-not-ready-to-yank-china-tariffs-but-open-to-talks\/?sh=e9709b05e8b7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Trade Representative Katherine Tai<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is open to trade negotiations but reluctant to suddenly reduce tariffs. She believes such a move could harm the US economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, the US-China trade war is still happening, and it\u2019s causing problems for both the US and China. Importers should be aware of its potential implications on the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The impact of the trade war<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While President Trump meant to cripple the Chinese economy while advancing US manufacturing, it seems that his goals were not realized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of floundering under the heavy tariffs, China has increased trade with other nations, most notably the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has surpassed the US to become China\u2019s largest trading partner. China has also expanded its trade to Europe and sub-Saharan Africa during the trade war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to an overall decline in imports from the US as well as other countries, China\u2019s trade balance has improved significantly. Many Chinese companies are now looking to move their manufacturing to developing economies such as Mexico and India that can serve the US market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the United States economy has greatly suffered from the trade war. Since Chinese manufacturers didn\u2019t lower their prices in response to the tariffs, the burden fell on US companies to pay for the trade war. Increased costs led to huge job losses and wage cuts for American workers. American farmers and manufacturers have also suffered from China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese exports to the US decreased by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/carnegieendowment.org\/2020\/06\/24\/in-u.s.-china-trade-war-new-supply-chains-rattle-markets-pub-82145\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$87 billion from 2018 to 2019 alone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This has led the United States to look elsewhere for its cheap labor and manufacturing needs. The main beneficiaries of this have been Vietnam, Taiwan, and Mexico. Perhaps this is the reason why US manufacturing remained stagnant even with the tariff protections granted by President Trump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2272\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/jordan-madrid-iDzKdNI7Qgc-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Navigating the trade war as an importer<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get too far into the political weeds of the trade war, it can be difficult to figure out exactly how it can affect you as an importer. Here are three keys to keep in mind to navigate the trade war.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b>1. Consider your supply chain<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you thinking about finding a supplier in China? Now may not be the ideal time for that. Although Chinese manufacturers are still some of the best equipped in the world to produce a wide variety of goods, manufacturers in several emerging markets could be rising up to take their place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many American companies are looking to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/tips-for-importing-and-or-exporting-to-southeast-asia\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">find suppliers in Southeast Asia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Don\u2019t forget to check out which countries the US has a free trade agreement with so you can save on tariffs and speed up the customs process.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b>2. Take tariffs into account<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve already decided to rely on a Chinese supplier, don\u2019t get blindsided by the hefty tariffs. Do plenty of research in advance so that you can allocate part of your budget to paying these tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be prepared for changes as the international atmosphere continues to shift. China is still the top global manufacturer, but there are some up-and-coming markets that might give it a run for its money. At this point, China is still a suitable place for you to find imports, as long as you have the funds to cover the tariffs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><b>3. Keep an eye on the news<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire import-export world is waiting to see what will happen with the trade war. Not only are American and Chinese businesses impacted by the trade war, but other nations are being negatively or positively affected as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an importer, it\u2019s extremely important for you to stay informed about international news so that you\u2019re prepared for whatever comes. Keep your ears open and look for opportunities that could come your way with the shifting tides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you feeling overwhelmed by all of the changes in international trade?
