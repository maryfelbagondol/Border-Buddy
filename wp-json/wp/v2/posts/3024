Some decry it as fear mongering, some take a more scientific approach and look at hard data. We\u2019re not here to preach, but more to share some findings that are interesting and even, hopeful, about the future of shipping via water. Whether land, air or water, importing and exporting makes the world function, so today we\u2019re taking a closer look at sustainability in shipping on water, and what that looks like.<\/p>\n<p>Shipping is essential to the world, certainly if you\u2019re an importer \/ exporter. More than 90% of all goods traded globally are transported by \u201csome 90,000 marine vessels\u201d via <a href=\"https:\/\/europe.oceana.org\/en\/shipping-pollution-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shipping Pollution | Oceana Europe<\/a>. However, the oceanic shipping industry has, like other modes of shipping, come under scrutiny due to the enhanced awareness and concern surrounding fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>Via European NGO Oceana,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver 90 percent of world trade is carried across the world\u2019s oceans by some 90,000 marine vessels. Like all modes of transportation that use fossil fuels, ships produce carbon dioxide emissions that significantly contribute to global <a href=\"http:\/\/eu.oceana.org\/our-campaigns\/stopping_climate_change\/campaign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate change<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/eu.oceana.org\/en\/stopping-climate-change\/acidification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acidification<\/a>. Besides carbon dioxide ships also release a handful of other pollutants that contribute to the problem.<\/p>\n<p>The shipping industry is responsible for a significant proportion of the global climate change problem. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More than three percent of global carbon dioxide emissions can be attributed to ocean-going ships.<\/span> This is an amount comparable to major carbon-emitting countries &#8212; and the industry continues to grow rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Shaping up oceanic shipping\u2019s carbon footprint &#8211; before shipping out<\/h3>\n<p>Our reliance on them for all modes of transportation is &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/next\/2022\/07\/23\/faster-cheaper-greener-are-drone-deliveries-the-future-of-logistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for now<\/a> &#8211; simply a reality. There is a reason to look more closely at water shipping, and also, there\u2019s also reason to feel hopeful, as many advances have been made and are being made that lighten the carbon footprint of oceanic shipping. Circular shipping is being explored, as are greater processes for streamlining ship space to carry the most cargo per trip, decreasing unnecessary idling, which is wasted fuel. Ports are also working on <a href=\"https:\/\/financialpost.com\/commodities\/energy\/renewables\/maritime-shipping-tries-to-reduce-emissions-but-key-obstacles-remain-in-its-lane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">becoming much more efficient<\/a> with timing and use of space, which is crucial as regardless as the size of the ships being built, ports and waterways are largely immovable.<\/p>\n<p>There is hope on the horizon for all modes of transport, which is good news for everyone, from import\/exporters to everyday consumers. It\u2019s an interesting time in importing and exporting, where a few blockages and\/or weather events have shown us that we simply must get more conscious and creative when it comes to sustainable transport &#8211; and that certainly includes shipping by water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we\u2019ll all float on\u2026okay? \ud83d\udea2\ud83d\udca6<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At BorderBuddy, we\u2019re always watching for trends and tips to maximize your importing\/exporting experience with us.
