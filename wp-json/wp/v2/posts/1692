It became clear that he had to invest in software, as spreadsheets didn\u2019t scale with his business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing in the market at that time suited his small business, so he wrote his own inventory management software, which would become Emerge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerge is extremely versatile&#8211;great for businesses of all sizes. It is suitable for B2B wholesalers, distributors, and e-commerce merchants. It provides solutions for import-export, inventory and accounts, and multi-channel sales. It streamlines the e-commerce management process by reducing human error.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emerge allows you to use as many currencies as you need in your business.

Slack has channels, which is where you can post everything related to a project, topic, or team. Everyone in a channel sees the same messages and stays on the same page. You can keep files and the messages about them together in channels. If working face to face is easier, go from channel to voice or video call in a click.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the features people really love is that Slack basically functions like a chatroom. Rather than searching through threads in your personal email, you can organize information by project or by team or client&#8211;and it is highly customizable to suit your needs. You can make your tools more accessible and useful by connecting them all in one place, build your own time-saving workflows and integrate your internal tools with the Slack APIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. <a style=\"font-family: 'proxima_novabold'; font-weight: 600;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hktdc.com\/\">HKTDC<\/a> Mobile apps<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed by the Hong Kong Trade and Development Council, these apps provide incisive economic and policy analysis, as well as market information from around the world to help companies capture opportunities for expansion and development.
