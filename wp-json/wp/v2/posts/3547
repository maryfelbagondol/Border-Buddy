It may seem straightforward, but it can actually be much more complicated than shipping to your American customers due to complicated Canada customs fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BorderBuddy\u2019s new Shopify <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.shopify.com\/canadacustomsduty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada Customs Duty App<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to focus on selling your products without having to worry about customs clearance. It\u2019s the perfect solution for easily shipping your products across the border.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Hassle-free shipments to your Canadian customers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Canadian customers are looking to buy something from a US merchant, they want to know exactly how much they will need to pay in import fees. If your Shopify site doesn\u2019t specify this amount, your customers may decide not to purchase your products due to fear of surprise fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BorderBuddy\u2019s Canada Customs Duty App eliminates the mystery by including the exact amount of required import fees at checkout. When your Canadian customers reach the shipping part of the checkout process, they will see the duties included in the shipping cost. This will give them confidence that they won\u2019t have to pay surprise fees when their package is delivered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the cost to your business? Downloading the Canada Customs Duty App is completely free. You will only be charged when a Canadian customer makes an order. The customs brokerage flat rate is just $15.00 per order. That\u2019s a 68% discount!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2595\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/usstage-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/usstage.png 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/usstage-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/usstage-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/usstage-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>The benefits of using the Canada Customs Duty App<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re new to exporting, the Canada Customs Duty App streamlines the process for you and makes it just as easy as shipping domestically. If you have lots of experience exporting but get easily frustrated by the confusing regulations surrounding customs fees, this app will relieve that customs stress so you can focus on selling to your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to do is enter your product information into the app, including the exact weight of the product. BorderBuddy will calculate the duty rate, which you\u2019ll then be able to approve before it goes live to customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a Canadian customer makes an order, BorderBuddy will automatically email you a DDP (Duty Delivered Paid) shipping label and a customs commercial invoice that you can attach to the package. The duties, shipping, and brokerage charges paid by the customer will be sent to your Shopify merchant payments account and will then be collected by BorderBuddy directly from your account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will only be responsible for packing up the order, attaching the shipping label and invoice, and handing the package off to the carrier. Once the package has been picked up by the carrier, BorderBuddy will take care of declaring the shipment to Canada Customs so that it can cross the border safely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For your customers, it couldn\u2019t be more simple. Instead of their packages being held ransom by the delivery truck until they pay unexpected customs fees, your customers will receive their packages quickly and without surprise costs. This positive experience will make them much more eager to order from you again in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2596\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/gettingstarted-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/gettingstarted.png 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/gettingstarted-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/gettingstarted-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/gettingstarted-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Canada Customs Duty App reviews<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies that have tried our Canada Customs Duty App are extremely satisfied with their experience.
