In a post-pandemic trade climate, following trends could be more important than ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although US imports, on the whole, are performing spectacularly compared to last year, there are 6 import categories that are down more than $1 billion from 2019. Each of these categories might reflect a change that has occurred due to the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret that COVID-19 has had a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/is-covid-19-still-affecting-importers-in-2021\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">serious impact on international trade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like everything else in the world). Countries are experiencing new product trends that can inform importers and exporters alike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at these 6 imports that have dropped significantly can help you choose more lucrative imports in the future. If you are currently importing any of these products, you might want to think about adjusting your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/a-sample-outline-for-your-import-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">import plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell products that have more immediate growth potential.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Passenger vehicles<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The category of passenger vehicles is down <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6.33 billion from 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This huge decline of 15.83% is mainly caused by the current <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/abc7news.com\/semiconductor-chips-chip-shortage-technology-cars\/10869896\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">computer chip shortage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This has led to a reduction in vehicle manufacturing. Other products affected by the shortage include appliances and consumer electronics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another possible cause of the drop in imported vehicles is the pandemic itself. Many people have been enjoying staying home more and not having a commute. The idea of buying a new car is not necessarily on their minds. Others have lost their jobs, meaning they can\u2019t afford to purchase a new car at this time. It\u2019s important to note that used cars are currently in high demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Oil<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil imports are down <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$6.33 billion from 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well, with a decline of 15.83%. This drop has been steady in recent years, with 2021 oil imports down 62.17% from 2013. Of course, oil has not been as vital during the pandemic, but that\u2019s only part of the story.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the US is leaning towards greater self-sufficiency and less imported oil. You might think this also reflects the trend of electric cars and sustainable fuel, but US oil consumption <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/international\/data\/world\/petroleum-and-other-liquids\/annual-refined-petroleum-products-consumption?pd=5&amp;p=0000001001vg0000000000000000000000000000000000g&amp;u=0&amp;f=A&amp;v=mapbubble&amp;a=-&amp;i=none&amp;vo=value&amp;&amp;t=C&amp;g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&amp;l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&amp;s=94694400000&amp;e=1577836800000\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continues to increase each year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For now, it appears this decrease in oil imports does not point to a decline in oil consumption.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Aircraft engines and parts<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which company is the leading exporter of the US? It\u2019s Boeing. Because of the problems that the plane manufacturer has been facing over the last year, aircraft engines and parts are down <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4.74 billion from 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s a shocking decline of 44.82%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The combination of Boeing\u2019s string of fatal crashes and the global pandemic that grounded most of the world\u2019s planes for an entire year has led to this significant drop. Because Boeing has slowed its manufacturing significantly, it doesn\u2019t need to import the same volume of aircraft engines it used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2376\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jakob-rosen-u-sloj664Rw-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Non-engine aircraft parts<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, Boeing\u2019s difficulties haven\u2019t just affected engine imports. Non-engine aircraft parts have fallen <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3.18 billion from 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a decline of 44.84%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you import anything tied to the airplane industry, you\u2019ve probably been feeling the disastrous effects of Boeing\u2019s downfall. Fortunately, United Airlines recently announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/29\/united-airlines-unveils-270-jet-boeing-and-airbus-order-its-largest-ever.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an order of 200 Boeing Max jets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for their post-Covid growth plan. That should boost aircraft-related imports in the next few months.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Gasoline<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gasoline imports have dropped <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.59 billion since 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a decline of 8.59%. Although the fall isn\u2019t as pronounced as that of imported oil, the reason for the decline in imported gasoline is probably the same. Again, the US is endeavoring to become more self-sufficient when it comes to oil and gasoline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may not directly impact you as an importer since you probably don\u2019t import gasoline. However, you can learn from this decline regarding the overall trends surrounding the automobile industry. Perhaps now isn\u2019t the best time to be importing products in this category.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Women\u2019s apparel<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the imports on this list, this one is probably the most difficult to explain. The category of women\u2019s apparel is down <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.02 billion from 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Surprisingly, the subcategory of women\u2019s pants alone accounts for approximately 40% of this loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps women aren\u2019t spending as much money as they used to on clothes. Another explanation is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/blog\/how-does-the-us-china-trade-war-affect-importers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US-China trade war<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has heavily impacted trade between the two countries. China went from being the top supplier of women\u2019s pants to the US as recently as 2020 to losing its number one spot to Bangladesh this year. It\u2019s possible that this supply chain disruption has caused fewer pants to be imported to the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>US imports that are soaring in 2021<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a break from the negative and focus on the positive. Which US imports are off the charts for 2021? What are some products you may want to consider importing in the future?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Computer imports are up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenroberts\/2021\/06\/30\/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each\/?sh=472beb572285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29.14% since 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and furniture imports are also up 25.17% since 2019.
