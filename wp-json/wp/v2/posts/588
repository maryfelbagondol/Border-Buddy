But buying a vehicle at an auction can also be one of the most stressful. It\u2019s one thing to go on test drives with friendly salespeople, kick some tires, drink their free coffee and then shop around. It\u2019s quite another to be bidding on vehicles in a high-pressure public auction against dozens of people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The experts at <a href=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BorderBuddy<\/a> are all about helping you find the best deal at a vehicle auction in the US and then ensuring you can import your vehicle into Canada.<\/strong> To get the best deal, you have to be prepared. And here are the things you absolutely must bring with you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. A Knowledge of What Kind of Vehicle Auction It Is<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Not every auction is the same. Some are called \u201cgovernment\u201d auctions, some are \u201cpublic\u201d. <a href=\"https:\/\/gsaauctions.gov\/gsaauctions\/gsaauctions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vehicles at government auctions<\/a> are generally considered well-maintained with accurate documentation because the government owner had to keep their employees on the road. Public auction vehicles are often considered more suspect, so <em>buyer beware<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Sharp Eyes + A Sensitive Nose<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You can usually fire up a vehicle at an auction but you can\u2019t drive it so your eyes are key in inspecting the interior and exterior for damage as well as any efforts taken to conceal that damage. Look under the hood. Check the dipstick to see oil levels. Note the VIN (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vehicle_identification_number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vehicle identification number<\/a>) on the windshield and then find another VIN, usually in the door, to ensure they match. (Sometimes, people will change them to hide a vehicle\u2019s past.) And don\u2019t forget to smell the interior. If there is a wet scent, that\u2019s a sure sign to steer clear.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. A Set Price<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Do your best to have in mind a set price you are willing to pay before entering the bidding process. If you have access to \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kbb.com\/car-advice\/articles\/what-are-kelley-blue-book-values\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blue book\u201d pricing<\/a>, you can check what the true value of the vehicle should be so you don\u2019t overpay.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Bring Cash<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Not to overstate the obvious, but make sure your financing is set. If you can pay a cash deposit, many auctions will give you a discount on the final price. But it\u2019s not just the money needed to buy the vehicle. You also need to ensure you have enough money to cover applicable taxes, title and registration fees plus shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Cool Demeanor<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Preparation will help you stay cool during the bidding process so you don\u2019t get caught up in the moment. Never be first to bid. Silence will often force the auctioneer to lower the price to get more people involved.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a vehicle in the U.S., or if you\u2019re considering buying one, BorderBuddy is here to ensure the importation process is smooth and stress-free.
