With all of the shipping options available to you, it might be difficult to sift through all of them and determine which one is best for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also some shipping options you probably haven\u2019t even heard of. PayPal Shipping might fall into this category for you. You know all about PayPal, of course, but you weren\u2019t aware they were involved in shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your situation, PayPal Shipping might be a great choice for your shipping needs. And if you\u2019re already used to using PayPal, it can be quite convenient for you to set up this shipping method for your small business or personal shipping needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What is PayPal Shipping?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PayPal Shipping is essentially a way for you to print out a shipping label from either USPS or UPS and get a discount in the process. Sound too good to be true? The partnerships between PayPal, USPS, and UPS make the discounts possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For UPS, you can receive up to 50% off UPS Ground shipments and 66% off UPS 2nd Day Air shipments. For USPS, you can save on a variety of domestic and international services, including flat-rate boxes, First Class Mail, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yes, PayPal Shipping tends to be cheaper than other options. But how difficult is it to set up? Although it takes some time to figure out how to create your first shipping label (especially if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account yet), you\u2019ll end up saving lots of time by not having to wait in line at the post office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the other benefits of using PayPal Shipping:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your shipments will be organized in one place<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll save time on shipping paperwork<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can prepare multiple packages to ship at the same time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can easily track your packages<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re able to customize your packing slips<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can ship almost anywhere in the world<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>PayPal Shipping for individual eCommerce sellers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is PayPal Shipping a good option for eCommerce sellers who sell on platforms such as eBay and Amazon? Since many eCommerce sellers already rely on PayPal for their customers\u2019 transactions, it\u2019s quite simple to add printing a PayPal Shipping label for each transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, you may be able to find a more affordable option through the eCommerce platform you work with. For example, eBay Shipping may be cheaper for you if you are a Top Rated Seller.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it\u2019s your choice whether to use PayPal Shipping or not. Keep in mind that you likely won\u2019t find a better price at the post office. If you do find a cheaper option, it will probably be through a different online platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2530\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/pexels-artem-podrez-5025639-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>PayPal Shipping for import-export businesses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you already have an established import-export business or you\u2019re planning to start one soon, PayPal Shipping might be a great choice for your shipments. Even if you don\u2019t use PayPal as the primary payment method for your customers, there is a way for you to print shipping labels using PayPal Shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s slightly more complicated to create shipping labels on PayPal Shipping when the purchases weren\u2019t made via PayPal, it can be worth it because of the money you\u2019ll save on shipping costs. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll still have to fill out customs forms and provide packing slips for international shipments. Fortunately, PayPal automatically prints out the customs forms you need along with your label.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t already offer PayPal as a payment option for your customers, you might want to start. PayPal is one of the most internationally recognized payment methods out there. If you\u2019re focused mainly on American and Canadian customers, you can probably get away with only allowing credit card payments. When you expand to international markets, however, you\u2019ll want to offer a more international payment option such as PayPal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to create a PayPal Shipping label<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there are several steps to creating a PayPal Shipping label, you\u2019ll be able to do it super quickly once you get the hang of it. Here is the process to follow:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Log in to your PayPal account.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have a PayPal account yet, you\u2019ll need to make one.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Go to your most recent transactions and expand the order you\u2019re printing a label for.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re making a label for a transaction that wasn\u2019t made via PayPal, it\u2019s rather difficult to find the right place to print the label. Bookmark <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paypal.com\/shiplabel\/create\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this link<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so you can easily navigate to the correct page for making a shipping label.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Enter the shipping information, such as the recipient\u2019s address and sender\u2019s address.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re working with a transaction that was made via PayPal, the shipping information should be entered automatically. Make sure you double-check it before confirming.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Choose which shipping method you\u2019d like to use.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, you\u2019ll choose between USPS and UPS. You\u2019ll also need to select a specific shipping method from the courier, such as UPS Ground or USPS First Class Mail. If you\u2019re located outside the US, you may have alternative postal courier options.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Enter your package information.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes the weight of your package in pounds and ounces as well as the type of package.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>6. Choose a shipping date.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PayPal will automatically choose the current date, but you can change it to a future date if you so desire.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>7. Calculate the cost of the label and purchase the label.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the button that says \u201cCalculate Postage Cost\u201d to know how much you need to pay. You can use your PayPal balance or a registered credit card to pay for the label.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>8. Print the label along with any customs forms.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click the \u201cPrint Label\u201d button. After that, you\u2019ll be directed to print out any necessary customs forms for your shipment.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>9. Ship your package.<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can either drop your package off at the post office or schedule a pickup at your home or business location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s all there is to it! Once you get into the habit of creating PayPal Shipping labels, you\u2019ll be able to do it without thinking. You\u2019ll love how much money and time you save by not having to make frequent trips to the post office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you planning on shipping to Canadian customers?
