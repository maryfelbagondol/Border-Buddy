How will you handle duties, taxes, customs clearance, and finding affordable shipping rates?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Shopify makes cross-border ecommerce much easier with its built-in support for carrier-calculated shipping. This allows you to tap into major carriers like UPS, FedEx, and DHL to instantly get real-time rate estimates at checkout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, we\u2019ll cover everything you need to know about activating carrier-calculated shipping on Shopify, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing to add carrier rates on different plans<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steps to enable carrier calculated shipping<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning on rates for additional stores<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting support when you need it<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s dive in!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing to Add Carrier Rates on Shopify Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the basic Shopify plan, carrier-calculated rates from third parties like UPS are not enabled by default. However, you can add this capability for an additional $20 per month by upgrading your subscription.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Advanced and Plus Shopify plans include activating carrier rates for free without any extra fees needed. So upgrading to one of these upper tiers is another route to enabling the feature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If selling internationally to markets like Canada is a core part of your ecommerce strategy, the slightly higher cost of an Advanced plan can pay for itself quickly through the benefits of calculated shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Activate Carrier Rates on Shopify<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve added carrier calculated shipping to your Shopify subscription, it\u2019s straightforward to toggle it on:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigate to Settings &gt; Shipping and Delivery in your Shopify admin.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under \u201cCarrier shipping\u201d, click on \u201cEnable\u201d or \u201cUpgrade your plan\u201d if needed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select the shipping zone you want to add rates for. Often this will be a \u201cRest of World\u201d zone for international orders.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click \u201cAdd rate\u201d and choose \u201cUse carrier or app to calculate rates\u201d when prompted.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search for and select the carrier accounts you wish to use, like UPS, FedEx, or USPS.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connect your carrier accounts by entering your account credentials when prompted.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s it! Shopify will now pull in live shipping rates from those carriers at checkout anytime an international customer views shipping options to their destination. No more having to manually update static shipping prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning On Carrier Rates for New Stores<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to activate carrier calculated shipping for additional new Shopify stores later on, you\u2019ll need to follow a slightly different process. <\/span>It&#8217;s worth noting that this applies <strong>not only to new stores but to all stores below the Advanced Plan threshold<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than enabling it directly from your store&#8217;s shipping settings, which notably lacks the toggle for the $20 option, you will have to get in touch with Shopify support. This can be done either through chat or email. Inform them that you wish to enable carrier rates for your store subscription, and they will assist in activating the feature swiftly.<\/p>\n<p>This extra step is due to how carrier rate permissions function across store accounts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching out to Shopify support via a chat is often the quickest way to get carrier rates switched on for a new store. Usually you\u2019ll be connected with an advisor within minutes who can enable it while you wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting Support When You Need It<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of Shopify support, chatting with advisors is the best way to get assistance if you run into any hiccups setting up calculated shipping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some key benefits of using Shopify\u2019s chat-based customer support:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instant 1-on-1 connection with knowledgeable shipping experts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability to share screenshots to tackle configuration issues<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidance specific to your store\u2019s setup and subscription tier<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No need to refresh email repeatedly awaiting replies<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you can also reach Shopify support via email or phone if preferred. But chat is often the fastest, most effective option for solving time-sensitive issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make Cross-Border Shipping to Canada a Breeze<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling beyond U.S. borders can seem intimidating for Shopify merchants at first.
