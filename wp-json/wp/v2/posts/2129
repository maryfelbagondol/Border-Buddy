Just ask any homeowner, parent, entrepreneur, or frequent traveler. The best thing to do is to remain aware of them in advance&#8230;and even then, you might still have to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The import-export industry is no different. Those who start an import-export business are often caught off-guard by some of the unforeseen international shipping costs they wind up paying. If you don\u2019t plan ahead, you can end up regretting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the complex nature of the import-export industry, many companies choose to hire a customs broker to take care of the shipping details. A customs broker can usually prevent you from paying certain fees and help ease the stress of the customs process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For everyone who\u2019s involved in an import-export business, here are 8 unexpected international shipping costs you should know about (and how to avoid them when possible).<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Storage fees<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might run into these fees if your goods are stuck at the port, airport, or land border for more than 3-5 days. Each country has different regulations and charges. Here are some reasons your goods might get stuck:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your documents are missing, incomplete, or incorrect<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have not paid the proper taxes and duties<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have the correct import permits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an exporter, your buyer was unaware of the shipment and did not complete customs clearance on time<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you have all of your documents and permits in order. If you believe there\u2019s a chance you might need to store your goods, contact your freight forwarder so they can request to put the goods in a bonded warehouse. This typically costs much less than storing them at the port.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2132\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-1024x667.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-768x501.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/frank-mckenna-tjX_sniNzgQ-unsplash-2048x1335.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Duties and taxes<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importers and exporters are aware that duties and taxes exist, but it\u2019s not common for them to know exactly how much they will owe for duties and taxes. Of course, this varies by country and classification of goods. For example, if you\u2019re importing goods to Canada, you\u2019ll need to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) regardless of whether the country you\u2019re shipping from has a free trade agreement (FTA) with Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, there is no way to avoid paying the required duties and taxes. But there is a way to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything. Hire a customs broker who knows the proper taxes and duties so your goods don\u2019t get delayed due to missing payments.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Shipping less than container load (LCL)<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two primary methods of shipping via ocean freight: full container load (FCL) and less than container load (LCL). While there are not necessarily extra charges to shipping LCL, it tends to be more expensive because you\u2019re paying for a section of the container rather than the full container. Goods also take longer to arrive and are handled more during the LCL process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a large enough shipment to fill an entire container, choose FCL. Try shipping goods in bulk whenever possible. If you have only a small shipment, you have no other choice than to use LCL. It still tends to be fairly affordable.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Customs exams<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s always possible that your shipment will be selected for a random customs exam, during which your goods will be inspected by the authorities. Even though the customs agency initiates the exam, it\u2019s the importer who is required to pay the fees associated with the exam. Here are some reasons your shipment may be chosen for a customs exam:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is one of your first few shipments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is coming from a certain country or geographic area<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is in a container with other shipments that were flagged for inspection<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Someone in your supply chain has made errors in the past<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have missing or incomplete paperwork<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You were randomly chosen<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your shipment is selected for a customs exam, there is no way to avoid paying the fees. While there\u2019s nothing you can do to be sure you won\u2019t be randomly chosen, there are some precautions you can take to lower your likelihood of having a customs inspection:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your paperwork is clear and complete<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declare the correct value of your goods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose established partners for your supply chain<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ship FCL instead of LCL whenever possible<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2131\" src=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/borderbuddy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/ronan-furuta-daSq9zhROxY-unsplash-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Port fees<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some ports have an extra fee that is charged when using that port. For example, Los Angeles has a port fee of up to $70 per container. While this is not a huge additional cost, it\u2019s important to be aware of nonetheless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide to use a port, you are subject to its port fees. Provided you are flexible when it comes to the port of arrival, it may be useful to look into the different fees for the ports you are considering and choose the port with the lowest fees for your cargo.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Damaged goods<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a risk that every importer or exporter takes on. During the long journey overseas, your cargo can face a variety of hardships, such as fires, storms, mishandling, and thieves. Of course, each of these scenarios could result in damages that can quickly sink a fledgling business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to protect your goods is to invest in international insurance for your import export business. International insurance is a safeguard against the damages you may incur during the shipping process.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. Customs fraud<\/b><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a dangerous and costly accusation that could befall you if you make a mistake in your customs paperwork. Declaring the wrong valuation or misclassifying your goods can result in a shocking charge of customs fraud. Believe me, you won\u2019t be happy to see a $50,000 fine that demands to be paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to avoid paying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way to prevent customs fraud is actually quite simple: hire a customs broker like <\/span><b>BorderBuddy<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
