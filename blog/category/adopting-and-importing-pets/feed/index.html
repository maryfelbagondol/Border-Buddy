										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our greatest delights at BorderBuddy is <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/precious-cargo-coming-through-fast-and-seamlessly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping to bring animals from all over the world</a> to new, loving, furever homes. Cats, dogs, we‚Äôve even helped home horses and an alpaca. We work with some of the best animal rescue organizations in the world to do this. Some of you may be aware that on September 28th, Canada is quietly banning the importation of dogs from countries deemed to be at high risk for rabies. Why September 28th?</p>
<h3>Why can‚Äôt I import rescue dogs from certain countries into Canada anymore? The surprising reason</h3>
<p>The reason may surprise you, it surprised us! In a nod to <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/rabies/countries-at-high-risk-for-dog-rabies/eng/1656375417730/1656375418777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Rabies Day</a> (üò≥), Canada will no longer accept the import of ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù dogs. The rules are as follows:</p>
<p>‚ÄúCommercial dogs include dogs intended for purposes such as being given/transferred to another person, resale, adoption, fostering, breeding, show or exhibition and research.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not unprecedented for animals crossing borders to be pre-screened for infectious illnesses, and/or undergo vaccinations for common ailments. Banning dogs from countries that the Canadian government has designated as high-risk for rabies does unfortunately mean that there will be fewer animals being rescued into Canadian homes.</p>
<h3>What countries are ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù for rabies according to Canada‚Äôs new laws:</h3>
<p>The following countries are considered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as being high-risk for rabies caused by canine-variant viruses (dog rabies):</p>
<p><strong>Africa</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Algeria, Angola</li>
<li>Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi</li>
<li>Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Comoros, C√¥te D&#8217;Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</li>
<li>Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti</li>
<li>Egypt</li>
<li>Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini (Swaziland), Ethiopia</li>
<li>Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau</li>
<li>Kenya</li>
<li>Lesotho, Liberia, Libya</li>
<li>Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique</li>
<li>Namibia, Niger, Nigeria</li>
<li>Republic of Congo, Rwanda</li>
<li>Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan</li>
<li>Tanzania (including Zanzibar), Togo, Tunisia</li>
<li>Uganda</li>
<li>Western Sahara</li>
<li>Zambia, Zimbabwe</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Americas and Caribbean</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Belize, Bolivia, Brazil</li>
<li>Colombia, Cuba</li>
<li>Dominican Republic</li>
<li>Ecuador, El Salvador</li>
<li>Guatemala, Guyana</li>
<li>Haiti, Honduras</li>
<li>Peru</li>
<li>Suriname</li>
<li>Venezuela</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Asia and the Middle East, Eastern Europe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan</li>
<li>Bangladesh, Belarus, Brunei</li>
<li>Cambodia, China (mainland only)</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq</li>
<li>Jordan</li>
<li>Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan</li>
<li>Laos, Lebanon</li>
<li>Malaysia, Moldova, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma)</li>
<li>Nepal, North Korea</li>
<li>Oman</li>
<li>Pakistan, Philippines</li>
<li>Qatar</li>
<li>Russia</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria</li>
<li>Tajikistan, Thailand, T√ºrkiye, Turkmenistan</li>
<li>Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan</li>
<li>Vietnam</li>
<li>Yemen</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is reviewed regularly by Inspection Canada and is subject to change.</p>
<p>Here are some organizations BorderBuddy has worked with include:</p>
<p>4Paws, Dog Gone Taxi, Las Animas Dog Rescue, The Pug Queen, and Thank Dog I am Out.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt let the headlines scare you, not all rescue dogs are banned from being imported into Canada. Countries like Mexico are still permitted, and there are many shelters in the USA that specialize in homing high risk for euthanizing animals &#8211; also known as high-risk kill sheltersüòî. Animal rights organization <a href="https://bestfriends.org/about/media/shelter-crisis-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Friend Society</a> has a complete list of high-risk kill shelters in the USA where you can bring dogs into loving homes in Canada (and beyond). There is a surplus of abandoned dogs thanks to the COVID-19 crisis, so while some animals will sadly be banned from crossing into Canada, there are countless others from all over the world who can still become your new best friend(s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you seen an adorable cat or dog on social media, with a sad story about its life on the street or in puppy mills, only to end on a happy, faith-affirming note that reassures you that the animal is living its best life, thanks to animal rescue. It‚Äôs enough to make you want to drop everything and rescue all of the animals! Only, the animal who has just stolen your heart lives in Mexico, or China, or even Michigan, so giving it this new leash on life can be a challenge. We‚Äôre here to help you make that leap without much legwork on your part.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2798 alignright" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-7-1.jpeg" alt="" width="288" height="360" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-7-1.jpeg 500w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-7-1-240x300.jpeg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" />BorderBuddy</span> has helped hundreds of cats and dogs find their furever homes. The pandemic saw a surge of people buying or adopting pets after finding themselves working from home, making pet ownership more accessible. With many returning back to the office and some of the kittens and puppies growing larger than the owners expected and world events, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/07/covid-dogs-return-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there‚Äôs a surge of animals</a> who need to be homed, from all over the world.</p>
<p>How to get that sweet soul into your home? BorderBuddy makes it easy. If you‚Äôre looking to adopt a cat or dog, BorderBuddy has a great network of animal organizations to work with in finding your new companion. There are lots, but here are a few we know to have excellent track records with animal adoption: <a href="https://donate.four-paws.org/s/ukraine?campaignId=7017R0000022njbQAA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWB8L94aaurDZcyb9O2peMF78RBNe3yvN8oUQyUOBXlniuK6MG1zP2hoCh1AQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Paws</a>, <a href="https://doggonetaxi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Gone Taxi</a>, <a href="https://lasanimasdogrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Animas Dog Rescue</a>, <a href="https://www.thepugqueen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pug Queen</a>, <a href="https://thankdogiamout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thank Dog I am Out</a>. <a href="https://doggonetaxi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Gone Taxi</a> is great if you‚Äôre moving and need help relocating your animal.</p>
<h4>In the words of Rebeca Berni-Hennie, Manager at DogGone Taxi:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">‚ÄúWe are specialized pet shippers, taking pets to/from the US Canada border by vehicle all the while bringing puppies and kittens to their new families. BorderBuddy has helped us during the COVID border shutdown. Having a good broker, navigate the ever changing requirements was needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We continue to move pets all over the world, and BorderBuddy is our go to partner for Canada/US shipments. It is important for pet owners to know that the CDC in the USA currently has limitations on dogs from certain countries, and if the pet has visited there in the past 6 months they will need a permit.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank Dog I am Out is an international, 100% non-profit organization with the mission to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome as many adoptable dogs and cats that are at risk of being surrendered, euthanized, neglected or abused as possible. They are based in Vancouver, BC, but rescue both locally and internationally. They even have some helpful tips, like finding a pet-friendly apartment, so <a href="https://thankdogiamout.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a look at their website</a>. You may find your newest family member.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2796 alignright" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-6-1.jpeg" alt="" width="283" height="424" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-6-1.jpeg 500w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-6-1-200x300.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /><a href="https://www.furbaerescue.dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fur Bae Rescue</a> is another international dog rescue organization, most recently they have been homing dogs from Qatar, but they rescue dogs from all over the world. Take a look &#8211; also based in Vancouver, but they will help you adopt and home your dog wherever ‚Äúhome‚Äù is, and BorderBuddy is there to make it smooth and seamless.</p>
<p>Mexico has a lot of stray animals, cats and dogs, and <a href="https://lasanimasdogrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Animas Dog Rescue</a> in Puerto Vallarta is just one of many Mexico-based organizations that have helped hundreds of dogs get homed. If you‚Äôre specifically looking for a cat, you can find felines in need of a loving home from all over the world with the <a href="https://www.torontocatrescue.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toronto Cat Rescue</a> . <a href="https://savingfancycats.org/international-cat-rescue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Fancy Cats</a> is a cats-only rescue organization that saves often purebred cats from the streets of the Middle East. These kitties aren‚Äôt your usual strays that we see in North America, the purebred cat industry is huge and unregulated in the Middle East, meaning countless ‚Äúfancy‚Äù cats are left to fend for themselves, and aren‚Äôt as ‚Äútough‚Äù.</p>
<p>4paws is a nonprofit that is currently doing everything it can to help all of the animals affected by the war in Ukraine. <a href="https://donate.four-paws.org/s/ukraine?campaignId=7017R0000022njbQAA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWB8L94aaurDZcyb9O2peMF78RBNe3yvN8oUQyUOBXlniuK6MG1zP2hoCh1AQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check them out</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd love to help you with your animal adoption journey, let‚Äôs <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get talking ASAP</a> and help bring your new family member home!</p>
<p>Things to consider when importing a pet to Canada that Customs will need to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial Invoice</li>
<li>Veterinary Certificate of Health (Must have been issued within 72 hours prior to import)</li>
<li>Rabies Vaccination Certificate</li>
<li>Import Permit (The import permit is only required for dogs less than eight months of age)</li>
</ul>
