										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Shopping for Sports Gear: Why Summer is a Great Time to Buy?</h3>
<p>Did you know that summer is a great time to score <a href="https://newtoski.com/best-time-to-buy-skis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better prices on things like expensive ski</a> and snowboarding equipment? While everyone is focused on the best sunscreen for swimming and what boat shoes to wear on what sailboat, retailers with the previous year’s winter equipment are often stealthily offering major discounts on winter sports gear. Usually, around Labour Day in Canada and the US is when the sale season starts to peak, but it’s happening earlier every year. In fact, summer is a good time to buy sporting equipment for almost any sport or season, as it is such a slow time for retailers, that they have to slash prices out of need to prepare for new stock.</p>
<p>So &#8211; while it’s sunny and lovely and winter seems oh so far away, we’ve rounded up some of the best used sports gear sites on the web, who will also still be selling all other sports goods, so you may come for skis and end up with a treadmill. Still &#8211; a discounted treadmill!</p>
<h3>Best in Snow</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2980" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/border-buddy-img-38-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/border-buddy-img-38-1.jpeg 1000w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/border-buddy-img-38-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/border-buddy-img-38-1-768x511.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Are you American and just love Canadian winter gear? <a href="https://www.sportinglife.ca/en-CA/equipment/ski/ski-boots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sporting Life</a> is a great one-stop shop for athletes of every age, skill and price point. Currently, Sporting Life has sales of up to 50% on expensive items like boots. You can search from everything from width, style to experience level and use their sale filters to find the best items for your budget.</p>
<p>For our Canadians looking to shop American sporting goods, why not check out <a href="https://www.moosejaw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moosejaw.com</a>? They have huge sales and carry all the US brands that can be hard to find in Canada, even online.</p>
<p><a href="https://sidelineswap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sideline Swap</a> is a very cool site where you can buy and sell items in a curated, social shopping exchange with equipment for every sport, including expensive items like golf clubs (there’s still time to golf!) and hockey pads to baseball bats and clothing. Sideline Swap also has a pretty cool mission, “We&#8217;re proud to be making sports more affordable, while keeping gear out of landfills.”</p>
<p>Next time you’re looking to buy some gently used sports gear for every sport, age, size and specialty, Sideline Swap is a cool place to check out.</p>
<h3>Fitness Equipment For The Private Buff</h3>
<p>Maybe you’re building a home gym? If so, <a href="https://www.fitnessavenue.ca/?gclid=CjwKCAjwoMSWBhAdEiwAVJ2ndhfm486LLspVqmH6GzfjlpuwVLQI6zqRU1ltBztAb2-MGgpmN7DqqRoCPuMQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fitness Avenue</a> has everything you need to build the gym that works for your workout style, and we’ll handle any importing fees. It’s based in Canada, so our Canadian shoppers wouldn’t have to worry about import fees, but for our American friends, we’d tackle that all for you so you don’t get any package shock when your new gym arrives at your doorstep.</p>
<p>Summer is a wonderful time to enjoy the great outdoors, and much of summer sporting fun doesn’t require a ton of gear. However, even if it’s not on your mind that Jenny’s going to need new goalie pads or that Peloton competitor you’ve been eying has been pushed to the cobwebs of your psyche, spending a few minutes on these sites could save you spending a lot more money when prices go up again.</p>
<p>As always, we’re here to help! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93xiqtmvbcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keep fit and have fun</a>, and if you have any questions, give us a (flex) wave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>ATVs</h3>
<p>All Terrain Vehicles, or ATVs, are a fun way to explore off road areas that are impassable by car because of rocky, narrow, uncharted terrain (what fun!). Whether you love them, loathe them or are intrigued by them, this article is for you! We’ll explore some of the ways to find and compare ATVs to get the best prices and style for your needs. We will also touch on the legalities that delight BorderBuddy customs brokers, who want to be along for the ride for as long as it takes to seamlessly and securely get your ATV or ATVs imported or exported across the border.</p>
<h3>What classifies as an ATV?</h3>
<p>You’ve seen them all over the place, on the beaches with police, appearing out of nowhere in otherwise silent forests, even on city streets, in some tropical locales, like Puerto Vallarta. An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) <a href="https://atvsafety.org/what-is-an-atv/#:~:text=An%20all%2Dterrain%20vehicle%20(ATV,and%20handlebars%20for%20steering%20control." target="_blank" rel="noopener">is defined as</a> a “motorized off-highway vehicle designed to travel on four low-pressure or non-pneumatic tires, having a seat designed to be straddled by the operator and handlebars for steering control.”</p>
<p>ATVs as an industry have been <a href="https://atvsafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PRSVIA060503FS_Emissions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working to lower their emissions</a> and increase their clean energy standards. In the U.S., ATV manufacturers have been working diligently with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of national emission standards. In Canada, they’ve also released a set of standards, available <a href="https://dieselnet.com/standards/ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Paperwork requirements for importing into Canada</h3>
<p>The Government of Canada regulates emissions from recreational engines, vessels, and off-road vehicles. This includes marine vessels, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and snowmobiles. Mandated by <strong>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</strong>, the <strong>Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)</strong> details emission standards for air pollutants and toxic substances from fuel systems of these vehicles.</p>
<p>The <strong>Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)</strong> assists in administering CEPA’s requirements when importing the vehicles into Canada. <strong>Memorandum D19-7-4</strong>, Importation of Engines, Vehicles, Vessels and Machines outlines the requirements for the importation of recreational engines, vessels, and <strong>off-road vehicles</strong> (ATVs).</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/importation-declaration-form-marine-spark-engines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Import Declaration Form</a> must be completed in full before import for:</p>
<h3>Off-Road Vehicles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Snowmobiles, off-road motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and utility vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Import Declaration Form</strong> must be completed by the importer of the above products when being into Canada for the purpose of sale and submitted to the Regulatory Administration Section, Transportation Division or Environment Canada.</p>
<p>A complete list of all of the various import regulations pertaining to almost anything with a motor in Canada can be found <a href="https://terminalcityriders.ca/articles/importing-bikes-and-parts-to-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It’s pretty hefty and full of hard to remember acronyms, so while a helpful tool to keep on hand, your best bet is to contact one of our BorderBuddy customs brokers if you’re unclear on or worried about anything.</p>
<h3>Let’s get ATV shopping!</h3>
<p>Here are just a few sites that buy and sell new and used ATVs. Private sellers, like all purchases, have their benefits and their challenges. <a href="https://www.kijiji.ca/b-atv/canada/c311l0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kijiji has a surprisingly big inventory</a> of ATVs, so they are definitely worth a perusal. <a href="https://www.autotrader.ca/motorcycles-atvs/atv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autotrader</a> is a very trusted name in the vehicle industry, mostly known for cars and trucks, they have diversified into ATVs and have a great selection. They also have solid paperwork and vehicle history records, so you may find that reassuring in making your choice. Another ATV buy and sell site that exclusively trades in ATVs is <a href="https://www.atvtrader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATV Trader</a>. They carry every major brand, have full ownership histories and also sell some parts and gear.</p>
<h3>When it’s time to get your ATV across the border, you know who to call!</h3>
<p>Once you’ve made your decision, contact us and we’ll get started on the duties and customs required by both borders to legally possess your ATV. If you want to get a sense of what you may owe in duties before you contact us, our free customs <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">duty calculator</a> is at your disposal. If you want to chat, our customs agents are always delighted to help and to chat, so <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give us a call</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadians-report-lengthy-passport-processing-as-interest-in-travel-rebounds-1.5881211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild backlog of passports</a>, at least in Canada, many Canadians are ditching their Eurotrips in lieu of one of the most cherished pastimes on any side of the border: the road trip. Are you thinking about buying or selling your RV? During the pandemic, many families decided to purchase RVs and mobile recreational vehicles as a way to abide by travel restrictions, while still finding ways to explore and enjoy precious holiday time. Others still have looked to RVs as a way to usurp skyrocketing home prices and live wherever the road takes them. Need help planning a trip? <a href="https://ca.outdoorsy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoorsy</a> is a great resource for all your planning needs &#8211; it’s even fun! Plus, it’s an excellent place to find RVs and even sell them.</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, if you’re looking to buy a new or used RV, here is a handy guide with tips to make it an easy ride. It’s not as simple as buying a car across the border, so we encourage you to read this carefully. When in doubt, contact us. Have a conversation with a real BorderBuddy customs broker who knows the intricacies of buying RVs and managing all duties associated with importing/exporting them. Try our free duty <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculator</a>!</p>
<h3>Supply &amp; Demand &#8211; COVID Affected RVs Too.</h3>
<p>Like almost everything, supply and demand has been impacted by challenges in the global supply chain. Unfortunately, RVs are no different. In fact, the COVID restrictions created a real vacuum for RV manufacturers with so many people looking to set out for close to home adventures. Many prospective campers are stuck on wait lists for new campers. But there may be another way, if you’re willing to forgo “new”. Motor Biscuit has an excellent and up to date <a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/search-results/?q=RVs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregator of RVs for sale</a>, so it’s a smart place to start browsing. Most RVs are private sales — though some dealers also use it — not unlike Craigslist, only this is targeted for RVs.</p>
<p>Canadians have it a bit easier than their Southern neighbors in the U.S. Statistically, Canadians already own more RVs and camper vans than Americans, so there is less of a drought of supply. Maybe the way Canadians are represented as hardy, plaid-wearing outdoorsy people is an accurate stereotype, after all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2846 alignnone" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-20-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-20-1.jpg 500w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-20-1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h3>Do I Need a Special License to Own and Operate an RV?</h3>
<p>Simply put, no. In most instances, RVs only require a regular driver&#8217;s license. Although it is always good to check with the provinces and states you are traveling in to be sure. Ensure you have had a valid driver’s license for over a year and are over the age of 25 to rent.</p>
<h3>Are the Rules Different in the U.S. vs Canada for RVs?</h3>
<p>There are different rules for bringing RVs into Canada versus bringing them into the U.S. But at least the border between Canada and the USA is open!</p>
<p>Getting started, you should begin paying the taxes due to America for purchasing your camper abroad. In addition, insurance is absolutely essential &#8211; you will need to make sure that the camper you wish to purchase is already insured fully and legally available for you to purchase. Once you purchase it, like any driven vehicle, <a href="https://rvainsurance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will need insurance</a>. Be sure to browse carefully here, and when in doubt, give us a call. We’d hate for you to get taken advantage of or scammed. There have been scams where buyers make most of a purchase for an RV online, only to discover that the vehicle doesn’t actually exist. Like all major purchases, do your due diligence, and feel free to leverage your friendly BorderBuddy customs agent for any questions you may have, as for some of them, RV purchases is an area of expertise.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://gorving.ca/compare-rvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RVing Canada</a> is a “must bookmark.” It’s not only a great place to buy and sell RVs, but it also has tons of tips on managing ownership, handling borders for travel, and much more. Give it a spin, you may find your dream RV and your next inspired road trip.</p>
<p>So how do we help you find your dream RV and get it legally documented for importing and exporting to and from the U.S. and Canada? Give us a call! Our BorderBuddy customs brokers are specialists in RV importing and exporting and would love to be part of planning your next great escape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 2 years of COVID restrictions making camping (and let’s be honest, most fun things) verboten, 2022 is your YEAR to explore the great, wild yonder. Before you set off into the wilderness with a backpack and a dream, let’s walk you through some of the best ways to be prepared for the unknown. Camping can be as rugged &#8211; or not &#8211; as you like, and much of that starts with the type of camping gear you have.</p>
<p>From tents that border on palatial, to fire kits that ignite your inner magician, we have some excellent tips, sites and ideas on how to find gear to buy or sell, and import and export across the U.S./Canada border with ease. We’ll take care of the duties and help make the borders disappear. Try our duty <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculator</a> for free and see what it could cost to import or export your new gear.</p>
<h3>Do I need to secure campgrounds? If so, how and how much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Yes &#8211; for the most part. Because of managing numbers and COVID tracing, you are still advised to reserve any campground in Canada. <a href="http://www.reservation.parkscanada.gc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parks Canada</a> has a good booking system that also keeps you up to date on things like water boil advisories, fire restrictions, and even fun things to do. For camping in the United States, there are many sites to use. We find <a href="https://www.reserveamerica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reserve America</a> to be the most expansive, easy to use and helpful. Individual campgrounds, like Yellowstone have their own booking, so once you have a destination in mind, you may wish to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check that site out independently</a>. It’s run through National Parks America, and is very trustworthy.</p>
<h3>I found the tent of my dreams but I want to leave for my trip in a week. Can you get it to me on time?</h3>
<p>Yes! BorderBuddy can help ship you any legal item in tight time frames, defined by you. You let us know the item or items, where it’s coming from and where it needs to get to and we’ll take care of all of the paperwork. We have a <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/shipping-across-the-pond-things-to-consider-when-shipping-outside-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful article</a> that runs through everything you’d need to consider for importing/exporting your camping goods, or anything, for that matter. If you would feel better speaking directly to an agent, a BorderBuddy customs broker will gladly take your call and questions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2852" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-22-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" width="702" height="468" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-22-scaled.jpeg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-22-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-22-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/border-buddy-img-22-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<h3>Is it more expensive to buy used gear from across the border than new gear in my home country?</h3>
<p>That completely depends on what you’re buying! <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoor-gear/g18758535/camping-gear-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular Mechanics</a> has a list of its top camping items, and they are pricey, but also new. If you cheekily use their list as reference, you’re almost guaranteed to be able to find comparable products that are not brand new, but still top quality on sites like <a href="https://secondgearwnc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Gear</a>, <a href="https://rerouted.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rerouted</a>, <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/used-outdoor-gear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Planet Edit</a>, and others. Buying used gear is one of the many ways that we can lessen our carbon footprint and avoid waste. After all, if you are a camper, chances are that you’d like to keep the Great Outdoors intact #leavenotrace. You can do your part while getting kitted out in top notch gear, and we’ll make sure it gets to you, seamlessly and on time.</p>
<h3>Can I bring my gear into Canada?</h3>
<p>Yes &#8211; in almost all cases. As long as you’re not bringing biological items, like soil or plants without declaring them and ensuring they’re good to cross, you’re okay. <a href="https://cyclinghikes.com/can-you-bring-camping-gear-into-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> is a wonderful resource with answers to lots of questions, some that may not even have occurred to you. <a href="https://cyclinghikes.com/can-you-bring-camping-gear-into-canada/#What_do_you_have_to_declare_at_customs_Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wondering about packing propane</a>? Wonder no more. Spoiler alert: it’s allowed.</p>
<h3>Safety requirements from the Canadian government</h3>
<p>Getting your new camp gear into Canada is relatively easy. The few stipulations that do exist are surrounding safety. Canada is strict about flammability <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/reports-publications/industry-professionals/industry-guide-canadian-requirements-tents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks with tents</a>, so you’ll need tents with proper safety labeling that indicate that your tent meets safety requirements.</p>
<p>Now is the time to get set up for camping, so we encourage you to browse, buy (or sell if you have goods to be re-loved) and contact BorderBuddy to help you get your physical goods. Your next memorable outdoor excursion is waiting for you, be sure you have the right gear to help you enjoy it to its fullest!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>You’ve found your dirt bike! Let’s get it across the border. A step-by-step guide, made just for you.</h2>
<h3>Step-by-Step Courtesy of <a href="https://youmotorcycle.com/how-to-import-a-motorcycle-to-canada.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Motorcycle</a></h3>
<p>1. Make sure the motorcycle you want to import from the <a href="https://youmotorcycle.com/how-to-import-a-motorcycle-to-canada.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. is even allowed in Canada</a></p>
<p>2. Know the rules to save money</p>
<p>Knowing how different laws will affect you importing a motorcycle to Canada from the USA is crucial, and here are two tips that can save you money:</p>
<p>Motorcycles that are assembled in the U.S. are exempt from duty fees at the border!</p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly most Japanese and Italian motorcycles — Honda and Ducati for example — are assembled in the U.S.</li>
<li>Every state has its own tax rate, and some states have no sales tax, which can save you even more money. Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire, Alaska, and Delaware don’t have a sales tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Know what you’re getting yourself into. Be as informed as you can about your purchase. Buying from a private seller can be riskier than buying from a dealership, so make sure you get all necessary information about a motorcycle before purchasing and beware of any red flags.</p>
<p>4. Do the paperwork</p>
<p>Importing a dirt bike into Canada is all about understanding the paperwork involved and getting it done right. This is our bread and butter!</p>
<p>The paperwork needed to import an American motorcycle to Canada is going to take some time. Once the sale has gone through, you need at least 3 business days for the paperwork to get processed.</p>
<p>The pieces of paperwork needed are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A “<a href="http://thethinkbox.ca/files/worksheet.doc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worksheet</a>”</strong> – download a sample at the link.<br />
You can contact the Border agency and have them send you the most current worksheet or you can find it online. OR, we can do that for you. So many options!</li>
<li><strong>A bill of sale</strong> (which requires both buyer and seller to have a signature of release on the back), or if the motorcycle is a new vehicle purchase you will fax a Certificate of Origin (both sides). Double check that the paperwork is completed properly or it could cost you more time!</li>
<li><strong>Recall clearance document.</strong> This document is a formal letter with a company letterhead that is signed or stamped, stating that the motorcycle has cleared the factory safety recalls and that all recall work has been performed. Basically, it’s an authorized dealership of the manufacturer you’re buying from. Example: an authorized Harley-Davidson dealer saying that your Harley-Davidson has no outstanding safety recalls, and that any recalls that were ever issued on this motorcycle were already solved.
<ul>
<li>Dealers must provide at least a screenshot printout from the motorcycle manufacturer service computer system, showing the VIN number, make, model, recall clearance and marked with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for work completion.</li>
<li>Note this information is only important for after you’ve crossed back over into Canada</li>
<li>After the 72 hours your paperwork takes to clear, you can call the border crossing to determine the status of your paperwork. This is an important step because if your paperwork was incomplete you will need to re-submit the paperwork. That means waiting an additional 72 hours to be cleared before you can move forward. Let BorderBuddy deal with all of this for you! That’s what we’re here for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Get insurance (if riding it)- Step 5 is about helping you get your motorcycle moving legally. If you’re transporting your new motorcycle on a trailer or on a pick-up truck, you will not need insurance on your new motorcycle until you’ve crossed the border. No one checks for insurance at the border.</p>
<p>6. Transporting your motorcycle (if not riding)</p>
<p>Whether you buy from a dealership or a private seller you must have the original title (Ownership) and a bill of sale. Have the seller fill out the transfer of ownership sections on the back of the title/ownership paper.</p>
<p>If you’re purchasing from a dealership, make sure you also have an original receipt with a cost breakdown. The breakdown should show how much of the total was for the motorcycle, parts, freight, PDI, etc.</p>
<p>7. Crossing the border &#8211; you definitely want BorderBuddy for this part! On the U.S. side of the border, you’re required to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorcycle</li>
<li>Bill of sale (a.k.a. Certificate of origin)</li>
<li>Original receipt with cost breakdown (if buying from a dealer)</li>
<li>Valid passport and photo identification</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Getting your dirt bike home.</p>
<p>The last step in importing a motorcycle to Canada is what you need to do when you get into Canada. First things first: send out your Form 1 paperwork, including the factory recall clearance letter you should have obtained. These must be sent to <a href="http://www.riv.ca/RecallClearance.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIV Canada</a> before you can proceed. Unfortunately RIV Canada can take up to a week to send you your <strong>Form 2</strong> paperwork so you’ll have to make some follow up calls or check the status online. BorderBuddy can manage that for you.</p>
<p>FINALLY, it’s time to register your motorcycle with the ministry. You’ll need to gather your Form 2, bill of sale (or certificate of origin if it’s a new bike), ID, and any other paperwork your local Service Canada requests to complete the registration of your motorcycle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Wc 765</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard the hum of a motor when you’re somewhere remote and wondered what the source is of that invigorating racket? Chances are, moments later, some muddy but exhilarated dirt biker emerged from the woods, speckled with dirt and grinning from helmeted ear to ear. As more people look to the great outdoors to spend their leisure time — often closer to home than picking up the family and boarding a plane — now is the perfect time to find a new or used dirtbike to put some horsepower behind your adventures. One question you might have &#8211; are dirt bikes considered motor vehicles, like motorcycles? In short, <a href="https://www.dirtbikeplanet.com/are-dirt-bikes-legally-considered-motor-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yes</a>, so they require similar licensing to own and operate as their choppier counterparts.</p>
<p>In Canada, there are many fewer motorcycles and dirt bikes than in the U.S. — 700K vs approx 13M. Thus, you have a much wider buying pool in the U.S. and may get a much better deal. Sadly, you can’t just buy a vehicle in the U.S. and chuck it in your car, cross the border to Canada and be done with it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we can help. Choosing dirt bikes for you and your (mature, able to handle the equipment) friends or family is rewarding, exciting, and easier than ever. Consider the border disappeared, that’s our promise to you. So don’t feel discouraged if the motorbike of your dreams is in Idaho and you’re in Nanaimo, B.C. We can get it to you.</p>
<h3>Conformity with Laws</h3>
<p>You’re legally required to keep records proving evidence of conformity for at least 6 years post date of the manufacture. If the records are maintained on your behalf, by a third party (like BorderBuddy), you must keep a record of the name, address and information of the person who keeps those records. With us, it’s part of our process.</p>
<p>The Canadian government recommends making necessary arrangements in preparation for showing evidence of conformity with the laws within the timeframe laid out by the government. It is unlikely, but possible that these records will be requested by the Minister of the Environment.</p>
<p>Be sure that your dirt bike/off road motorcycle outlined in the conformity/EPA certificate matches your product. It’s a no brainer, but we err on the side of caution so that you don’t get any surprises.</p>
<h3>The Legalities of it all &#8211; Importing a Bike from the USA into Canada</h3>
<p>As a country trying its hardest to preserve natural beauty and manage emission targets, it’s not a surprise that Canada has stringent laws when it comes to importing exhaust creating (carbon emission generating) products, be they farm equipment or leisure craft, like dirt bikes.</p>
<p>From the Government of Canada website:</p>
<blockquote><p>“​​Emission standards for on-road motorcycles are governed under the On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations (regulations) established under the authority of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA).</p></blockquote>
<p>Your BorderBuddy expert will be able to answer any questions about duties and regulations. You can also try our <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free calculator</a> to see what it will cost to bring or export your dirt bike.</p>
<h3>Required Reading: What Is Considered an “On-Road Motorcycle”</h3>
<p>On-road motorcycles have been <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/importing-motorcycles-road-vehicle-regulations-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined for emission</a> purposes as on-road vehicles with a headlight, taillight and stoplight that have two or three wheels and a curb weight of 793 kilograms (kg) (1749 pounds) or less. Any motorcycle that can’t exceed 40km (25mph for our non-metric buddies) on paved ground isn’t seen as an “on-road vehicle”. Simply put, any “motorcycle type” vehicle not considered to be an on-road vehicle is recognized as an “off-road recreational vehicle”. They carry their own emission standards under the <a href="https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/environmental-protection-registry/regulations/view?Id=85" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Marine Spark-Ignition Engine, Vessel and Off-Road Recreational Vehicle Emission Regulations</em></a>.</p>
<h3>Prior to Importation</h3>
<p>In order to bring your dirtbike into Canada or the U.S., you must follow conformity regulations for the EPA/Environment and Climate Change Canada. We’ve copied a chart below to break it down, but if it makes you more confused than confident, you know who to call *ahem*. There is also this handy guideline specifically about <a href="https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/environmental-protection-registry/regulations/view?Id=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions legislation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With summer creeping up on us, it’s easy to start daydreaming about what kind of adventures you can take, solo, with friends, family &#8211; wherever the spirit takes you. What better way to explore than on a bicycle? Zero emissions, zero dollars spent on gasoline, a great workout and much easier to park. Cheaper, too!</p>
<p>But getting that perfect two wheeled companion takes a bit of work, especially if you’re looking for any sort of specialty bike. From ultra lightweight road bikes for zooming around, to heavy duty mountain bikes built to handle more challenging terrain, there’s a whole world of bikes out there. With easy shipping, you don’t need to limit yourself to your local selection. In fact, the sooner we help you narrow your search while simultaneously opening up cross border possibilities, the sooner you can start exploring on your new chariot.</p>
<p>We take care of customs so you can get your hands on the bike of your choice, wherever it is in the world. For small orders like a bike or bike parts, we have a simple, streamlined process that takes care of any paperwork and border duties so you don’t have to. By browsing a few <a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/general-cycling-discussion/1182556-shipping-canada-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bike forums</a>, it’s easy to see that many would-be bike owners have found themselves in love with a bike they’ve seen on their travels or even found online, but are flummoxed at how to get their hands on it whilst staying abreast of the requisite duties. That’s where our <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculator</a> comes in handy!</p>
<p>Let’s start browsing, shall we? Here are some sites that we love to visit and “window-shop”.</p>
<h3>How to Buy from Private Sellers</h3>
<p>Lots of places where you can buy bikes also have their own shipping schemas built in, which sometimes works in your favor, sometimes doesn’t. Please note that while we’d love to be your partner in importing or exporting your bike, our bottom line is making sure you’re happy and satisfied, so consider us a resource for you as you make your buying and/or selling decisions. <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-buy-a-used-or-second-hand-bike-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bike Radar</a> is a terrific, unbiased resource for anyone looking to buy a used bike and what pitfalls to watch out for. We recommend giving them a few clicks as they are knowledge leaders in their space and their passion lies in satisfying would-be bike enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Taxation and Importing Bicycles into Canada</h3>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://terminalcityriders.ca/articles/importing-bikes-and-parts-to-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing whole bikes VS bike parts into Canada carry different taxation laws</a> and fee rates. For instance, a complete bike falls under customs tariff #8712.00.00, which has a 13% tax rate PLUS GST/HST, which can add up. However this rate only applies to “complete&#8221; bikes. Subcategories are then based on wheel size. If the bike you want to import has no wheels, it’s not recognized as a complete bike. Thus, you can avoid the 13% tax rate and pay 6.5% if you get a bike without wheels. You can have the wheels shipped separately, or not at all.</p>
<p>If you just want the hub, ask the seller to solely send the hub. You’ll not only avoid 6.5% duty, but the package will be much smaller, and so will the shipping costs.</p>
<h3>Finding Bikes to Browse</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com/s/road-bikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bike Exchange</a> is a mega website with every kind of bike and part you could need. From custom bikes to refurbished race bikes, it has everything. It even has handy guides like <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com/blog/factors-consider-buying-bike-rack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to buy the best bike rack</a>. It’s a huge company, which may be daunting for some, so if nothing else, it’s a great resource for all things biking.</p>
<h3>Used Bikes</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theproscloset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pro’s Closet</a> is an incredible and interactive site, with new (used) stock being added hourly. It even shows you how many hours ago a certain bike was listed, and it is a visually delightful site. This buyer’s delight also has a <a href="https://www.theproscloset.com/pages/certified-pre-owned#returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handy comparison matrix</a> on the different perks of buying with them versus a marketplace or private seller. If you do find a private seller on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or other buy and sell networks, BorderBuddy can take care of everything with importing and exporting duties.</p>
<p>You could be pedaling through the winding, pastoral roads of France or supercharging your adrenaline on soaring altitudes in the trails in Squamish &#8211; you find your bike and we’ll handle the duties and legalities of getting it to you! <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-our-free-customs-duty-calculator/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact us today</a> and let’s get you riding.</p>
