										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your Shopify store beyond domestic borders can seem like an intimidating leap, especially when it comes to navigating the complex world of international shipping and hidden fees. However, e-commerce merchants who have tried BorderBuddy&#8217;s services for streamlined shipping from the U.S. to Canada have found it simplifies the entire process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy is a Shopify app that handles customs documentation, duties calculation, and shipping label generation for stores fulfilling orders to Canada. This eliminates surprise fees and headaches often associated with cross-border delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But does BorderBuddy really deliver on its promises? Here we&#8217;ll examine real customer reviews to see what users have to say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>No More Nasty Surprise Fees</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common pain point highlighted by merchants is surprise brokerage and import fees levied on their Canadian customers upon delivery by major carriers like UPS, FedEx and DHL. These fees can often be over $50-$100, even on small orders, leading to unhappy shoppers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As IOThrifty, a B2B store selling office products, shared:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We struggled for years trying to find a way to minimize the high brokerage rates and import fees charged by the major freight carriers. Many of our customers are used to the high fees but we still got complaints from a few angry customers.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy solves this by providing an all-inclusive estimate right at checkout, rolling duties, taxes and their fixed $15 customs brokerage fee into the upfront pricing. The customer pays the full amount during purchase, eliminating any surprises down the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the owner of For the Love of Golf Naples put it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;BorderBuddy has truly changed the game. Our customers are SO appreciative of not getting hit with random fees upon delivery.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Significant Cost Savings</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the transparency, BorderBuddy saves both merchants and shoppers money by drastically reducing brokerage fees. This allows merchants to offer more competitive shipping rates to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one merchant explains:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before using this app UPS charged us $50 to $100 just for customs brokerage fees! But BorderBuddy only charges a fixed $15 fee. The shipping rates are almost exactly the same as Shopify&#8217;s calculated rates. Huge savings on all levels.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering most major carriers can charge brokerage fees ranging from 20-45% of an order&#8217;s value, BorderBuddy&#8217;s flat $15 fee is a massive reduction in many cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Fast and Easy Setup</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating any new app into an e-commerce store can be a tedious process, but merchants found getting started with BorderBuddy smooth and fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the team at GnarLab shared:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Integration was easy. After a customer places an order, BorderBuddy sends you a shipping label and commercial invoice. Print and go. That&#8217;s it!&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most stores, it&#8217;s a simple matter of installing the app, connecting it to a Canada shipping zone, and letting BorderBuddy handle the customs paperwork and label generation when orders come in. No major development work required.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Better Shipping Rates to Canada</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy doesn&#8217;t just estimate duties and taxes upfront. It also provides calculated shipping rates optimized for Canadian delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rates end up being highly competitive, and sometimes even cheaper than what Shopify alone can offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one happy customer reported:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Usually their shipping rates are almost exactly the same as Shopify&#8217;s calculated low rates. And best of all, no issues with any shipments so far.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By partnering with major carriers like UPS, FedEx and DHL, BorderBuddy&#8217;s Shipping to Canada service can leverage bulk discounts that translate into savings for merchants. This gives stores more margin to offer customers free shipping or other incentives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Proactive Customer Support</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transitioning to a new logistic system can come with hiccups, especially when first learning the ropes. So having knowledgeable support can be critical during the initial setup process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy&#8217;s personal touch and prompt responsiveness left an impression on merchants:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very responsive customer service team! Monty provided quick step-by-step instructions to fix our issue, had great insight into the Shopify platform, and stayed in contact consistently to ensure our journey was a success.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having access to real human assistance via phone, email or chat, combined with helpful onboarding resources, empowers merchants to maximize their use of BorderBuddy&#8217;s capabilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Unlocking the Canadian Market</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest benefits highlighted by users was BorderBuddy&#8217;s ability to unlock the lucrative Canadian market for Shopify stores. By eliminating surprise fees and other shipping friction, it becomes very attractive for both merchants and Canadian shoppers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Artillery Works Co. shared:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So simple and trouble-free. Our customers are SO appreciative. Monty has truly been a pleasure to work with as we grow our business in Canada thanks to Border Buddy!&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app solves the exact pain points that typically deter cross-border e-commerce, leading to more sales and expanded revenue potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the team at GnarLab explained:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;BorderBuddy has really transformed the way we do business with our friends in Canada! We run a small startup out of the US and get a healthy percentage of sales from Canadian customers. Shipping before BorderBuddy resulted in unexpected fees passed onto customers (upwards of 80%-90% order total) or lost packages (40% of orders). BorderBuddy makes the process easy. There are no unexpected fees or issues since using BorderBuddy!&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Optimizing the Customer Experience</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, BorderBuddy improves the post-purchase customer experience for Canadian shoppers by removing unwanted surprises and simplifying delivery. This leads to higher satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one merchant put it:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our customers are so much happier not being surprised by extra import fees. The simplicity has led to happier Canadian shoppers and less headaches for us.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than dealing with frustrated calls or refused/returned packages from carriers due to fees, Canadian customers can enjoy a smooth delivery process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainty also plays a role. Customers have confidence knowing exactly what their final charges will be upfront. And merchants have peace of mind knowing shipments will clear customs without hassles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As CHEFtog summed up:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fantastic app &amp; support is outstanding! Solved our biggest issue &#8211; shipping to Canada. When customers checkout, they now see (shipping + duties). No duty surprises once they receive their item.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ready to Simplify Cross-Border Shipping?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the enthusiastic feedback from merchants, BorderBuddy has proven to be a game-changer when it comes to unlocking international e-commerce potential. By tackling the biggest pain points like surprise fees, customs complexity, and shipping uncertainty, the app empowers Shopify stores to expand beyond their domestic borders.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s interconnected world, the importance of logistics in the global supply chain cannot be overstated. As businesses venture into international markets, they face a multitude of logistics challenges. From supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic to the intricacies of container shipping across borders, the logistics landscape is constantly evolving.</p>
<p>This article aims to provide insights into these challenges and offer solutions for businesses to thrive in this dynamic environment.</p>
<h1><strong>The Current Landscape of Global Logistics</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Recent Disruptions</strong></h2>
<p>The digital transformation has brought about significant changes in the logistics industry. However, the recent labor shortages, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused disruptions in global supply chains. The shortage of drivers and the escalating freight costs have further strained the shipping industry, making it difficult for many logistics companies to meet delivery timelines.</p>
<h2><strong>Demand and Supply Costs</strong></h2>
<p>The advent of digital technologies has reshaped the logistics landscape, introducing both opportunities and challenges. While it has streamlined many logistics operations, it has also introduced variability, making demand planning a significant challenge. The balance between supply chain visibility and managing transportation costs is more crucial than ever.</p>
<h1><strong>Overcoming Barriers in International Shipping</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Cultural and Language Differences</strong></h2>
<p>As businesses expand into multiple markets, they often grapple with cultural nuances and language barriers. For instance, a simple mistranslation can lead to significant shipment delays. Bridging this gap requires cultural training, local expertise, and leveraging digital technologies.</p>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Navigating the maze of government regulations, tariffs, and environmental standards is daunting. Understanding tax codes, ensuring compliance, and staying updated with changing rules is essential for smooth international expansion.</p>
<h1><strong>Strengthening the Supply Chain: Best Practices</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Embracing Digital Solutions</strong></h2>
<p>Supply chain visibility is the cornerstone of efficient logistics. A robust global transportation management platform can offer real-time data, ensuring timely decision-making and improved efficiency. Leveraging management software can further streamline operations.</p>
<h2><strong>Efficient Warehouse Management</strong></h2>
<p>Errors in warehousing can ripple through the supply chain. Reducing these requires meticulous planning, automation, and choosing the right management partner.</p>
<h1><strong>Working with Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Providers</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Advantages of 3PLs</strong></h2>
<p>3PLs offer flexibility and scalability, adapting to the ever-changing logistics landscape. Their expertise and experience can be invaluable in navigating logistics challenges, especially when companies need to outsource certain business operations.</p>
<h2><strong>Ensuring Customer Satisfaction</strong></h2>
<p>Managing customer expectations is paramount in the ecommerce era. With the rise of online shopping, customer experience has taken center stage. Strong communication at all levels ensures that customer expectations align with the realities of shipping.</p>
<h1><strong>Sustainability and Social Responsibility in Shipping</strong></h1>
<p>The demand for sustainable solutions in the logistics industry is skyrocketing. Businesses must prioritize eco-friendly practices without compromising on their bottom line. Balancing sustainability with cost efficiency and ensuring health and safety standards are met is the new challenge for the logistics industry.</p>
<p>It falls upon businesses today to not only focus on eco-friendly practices that aim to decrease environmental impact, but also to ensure these efforts do not compromise the profitability and efficiency of the business processes.</p>
<p>In addition to environmental concerns, the logistics industry also needs to guarantee the health and safety standards in their organizations. Social responsibility in this industry primarily includes ensuring the well-being of the workforce, striving for safer work practices, and upholding ethical labor standards.</p>
<p>In the face of these extensive challenges, the integration of sustainability and social responsibility into the very fabric of the logistics industry represents not just a corporate effort, but a collective global initiative.</p>
<h1><strong>Looking Ahead: Predictions for the Future of Shipping and Logistics</strong></h1>
<p>The future beckons with technological advancements like AI and blockchain. Collaboration within the industry will be key to harnessing these innovations. Supply chain managers will need to evolve their strategies, focusing on resilience, adaptability, and leveraging new technologies and systems.</p>
<h1><strong>The Role of Major Players in the Logistics Industry</strong></h1>
<p>Companies like McKinsey have provided insights into the global supply chain disruptions and the challenges faced by the logistics industry. Their research and findings have been instrumental in shaping strategies for businesses worldwide. The primary role of these major players includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing Logistics Services:</strong> Companies like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and Maersk are among the leading logistics providers worldwide. They offer services such as freight transport, warehousing, distribution, order fulfillment, and supply chain management. These players have a critical role in ensuring that goods move efficiently from production sites to end consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Using Technology to Improve Efficiency:</strong> Leading logistics companies have also been pioneers in adopting technological innovations to enhance their services. They use technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet of things, and blockchain to improve their service quality, reduce costs, and increase efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Developing Infrastructure:</strong> Major players contribute significantly to developing necessary infrastructure such as ports, logistics parks, warehouses, and transport networks. For instance, companies like DP World are heavily invested in building state-of-the-art logistics infrastructure globally.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> They also play a crucial role in shaping policies impacting the logistics industry. They engage with policymakers and regulatory bodies to advocate for favorable industry measures, such as lowering custom duties and simplifying procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Industry Insights:</strong> Consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG offer valuable insights into the logistics industry. Their research helps in understanding industry trends, identifying challenges, and crafting suitable strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability Focus:</strong> With increasing awareness about environmental issues, major players in the logistics industry are also taking a lead in sustainability. They invest in green technologies and practices to reduce their carbon footprint and make their operations more sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Training and Development:</strong> They play a crucial role in training and upskilling the workforce in the logistics industry to handle new technologies and trends.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the major players in the logistics industry play multiple roles, from supplying crucial services to providing technological innovation, infrastructure, and industry insights. They also advocate for favorable government policies and invest in sustainability and workforce development.</p>
<h1><strong>Addressing Bottlenecks and Ensuring Smooth Operations</strong></h1>
<p>Bottlenecks in the shipping process can lead to significant delays. Companies must prioritize resolving supply chain issues to ensure a high level of service. This includes investing in training and support for logistics professionals, exploring alternative routes, and ensuring enough drivers for timely delivery.</p>
<p>The logistics puzzle, with its many moving parts, remains a challenge for the logistics industry. Yet, with the right strategies and a keen understanding of market trends, businesses can piece it together.</p>
<p>Embracing digital transformation, prioritizing customer service, and ensuring supply chain visibility are the way forward. As the world continues to change, businesses must remain competitive, adapt, and plan ahead to ensure success in the global marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Expanding Business Horizons: The Canadian Opportunity 101</strong></h1>
<p>The allure of expanding sales into new territories is undeniable for businesses. It promises increased revenue, broader brand recognition, and a diversified product and service portfolio. Among the top destinations for such expansion is Canada. With its affluent population, advanced technology, and robust economy, Canada is a goldmine of opportunities.</p>
<h1><strong>Why Choose Canada for Business?</strong></h1>
<p>Canada boasts one of the world&#8217;s top ten economies, offering myriad opportunities across various sectors. The country&#8217;s policies actively encourage foreign business investments, making it an attractive destination for companies eyeing expansion.</p>
<p>Its proximity to the United States is a significant advantage, especially for American businesses. The shared language, cultural similarities, and consumer preferences make the transition into the Canadian market smoother and less risky.</p>
<p>This is particularly beneficial for businesses involved in international shipping. For a deeper dive into this, our guide on &#8220;<a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/8-tips-to-remember-when-expanding-your-business-to-international-shipping/">8 Tips to Remember When Expanding Your Business to International Shipping</a>&#8221; can be invaluable.</p>
<h1><strong>Understanding the Canadian Market and Tax Obligations</strong></h1>
<p>Canada&#8217;s appeal as a market lies in its stable economy, business-friendly regulations, and a population with significant purchasing power. As of 2021, Canada&#8217;s GDP stood at approximately 1.64 trillion USD, ranking it the 10th largest global economy. The country&#8217;s strong retail market, growing e-commerce sector, and large middle-class population further enhance its attractiveness.</p>
<h1><strong>Canadian Tax 101: Navigating Sales Tax and Obligations</strong></h1>
<p>When conducting business in Canada, understanding the tax landscape is crucial. Canada has a unique tax system, with both federal and provincial sales taxes. The federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Provincial Sales Tax (PST) are two primary taxes that businesses should be familiar with. Some provinces, like British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, have a harmonized sales tax (HST) that combines both.</p>
<p>For e-commerce businesses, understanding tax obligations becomes even more critical. Sellers must be aware of the tax rates in different provinces and ensure they remit the correct amounts. For instance, while Alberta has no PST, Toronto in Ontario has a higher rate due to the HST.</p>
<p>Businesses, especially those from the U.S looking to enter the Canadian market, must also consider registration with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). This is essential for remitting taxes and understanding potential exemptions.</p>
<h1><strong>Cultural Nuances and Sales Strategies</strong></h1>
<p>To truly thrive in Canada, businesses must grasp the cultural intricacies that influence consumer behavior. Here are some pivotal factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Politeness and Respect</strong>: Canadians prefer respectful communication over aggressive sales tactics.</li>
<li><strong>Multiculturalism</strong>: An inclusive sales strategy that appreciates diversity is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: Bilingual marketing materials in English and French, especially for regions like Quebec, are crucial.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Building Relationships with Canadian Customers</strong></h1>
<p>Success in the Canadian market hinges on understanding and catering to the unique needs of Canadian consumers. This involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizing offerings to align with local preferences.</li>
<li>Crafting marketing campaigns that resonate with the local audience.</li>
<li>Building trust and demonstrating value to foster loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Partnering with Local Canadian Businesses</strong></h1>
<p>Collaborating with local Canadian entities can be a game-changer. Such partnerships provide insights into the local market, facilitate resource sharing, and reduce risks associated with entering a new market. They also enhance product quality and foster community engagement.</p>
<h1><strong>Thrive in Canada</strong></h1>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since e-Commerce has opened up the global marketplace, the world is becoming a much smaller place. BorderBuddy was built on the belief that e-commerce would be a burgeoning business, and we were right. COVID only made us, well, more right.</p>
<p>Like everything else in the world, e-commerce was deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. From supply chain woes, to closed borders, to less disposable income, to soaring inflation, limiting the average consumer’s buying power, COVID-19 had a hefty and enduring impact on e-commerce as an industry.</p>
<h3>E-commerce: what is it (still) good for? Almost absolutely everything</h3>
<p>According to the Economic Times of India, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/e-commerce-opportunities-set-to-grow-for-smes-under-new-normal-fedex/articleshow/94531364.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce opportunities are actually well positioned for growth for SMEs</a> (small and medium enterprises) under the “new normal”, via FedEx. Despite prices for ocean freight increasing dramatically year over year, consumer spending online during the 2021 holiday season grew 8.6% year-over-year to a record $204.5 billion (source: Adobe Digital Economy Index). E-commerce continued to surge, “adding an additional 19% sales growth for 2020, and additional 22% sales growth to the existing 9% and 12% regular forecast sales growth rates, respectively.”, via <a href="https://www.trade.gov/impact-covid-pandemic-ecommerce#:~:text=This%20chart%20shows%20us%20clearly,forecast%20sales%20growth%20rates%2C%20respectively." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>Despite every possible reason to falter, online consumer spending for 2021 went up by 9% to a record (staggering) $855B USD, according <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-U.S.-Consumers-Spent-1.7-Trillion-Online-During-the-Pandemic-Rapidly-Expanding-the-Digital-Economy/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe’s US Consumer Spending Study in 2021</a>.</p>
<h3>Why should you care?</h3>
<p><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/interview-with-borderbuddys-innovation-lead-monty-mccallum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last month</a>, we interviewed BorderBuddy’s innovation lead, the wildly talented technologist, Monty McCallum. He shared some key info about BorderBuddy’s proprietary software, the <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/partners/247labs1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BorderBuddy Shopify app</a>. Using BorderBuddy’s Shopify app for your own shipping needs is easy, quick, and the app is free to download. It syncs seamlessly within Shopify, so whether you’re a consumer or a merchant, capitalizing on the growing demand for real-time e-commerce has never been easier, nor more financially rewarding. COVID pandemic-related business restrictions forced a global business paradigm shift towards the digital economy, i.e. e-commerce. Traditional brick and mortar retailers suffered if they didn’t innovate, and BorderBuddy made it easy for anyone to become e-sellers.</p>
<p>Watch BorderBuddy CEO, Graham Robins, explain how BorderBuddy’s app works, and how your next lucrative side hustle could be capitalizing on the ongoing strength of e-commerce:</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9jsjlKG7Uk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>How does it work: <a href="https://youtu.be/e9jsjlKG7Uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/e9jsjlKG7Uk</a></p>
<p>Another reason to consider e-commerce as a good bet for the future, the sake and ease with which you can now monitor border wait times through BorderBuddy means your side hustle could be making you money, while you watch its progress from the safety and comfort of wherever you are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn’t love a good deal? Black Friday has turned into at least a week-long affair, with pre-Black Friday sales, “Cyber Monday”, “Cyber Monday Weekend”. Paying full price? Unheard of. Canadians are spending more on Black Friday sales every year, with 61% expected to spend.</p>
<h3>How to stay in the black for US Black Friday shopping</h3>
<p>However, there is a caveat to many of these massive sales, especially if you’re a Canadian who is shopping online for US bargains. Not unlike the good Superbowl Commercials, many coveted brands aren’t available in Canada. So, how do you get your hands on some serious bargains without getting unexpected, hefty duty fees? BorderBuddy is here to help, in a few key ways. Firstly, you can always use our <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free duty calculator</a>. If you can’t get an immediate quote, an agent will email you an estimation, free of charge, so you can make informed buying decisions. Secondly, we’ve gone ahead and done research for you on the brands with the best all-in prices for their online holiday sales. Here are some go-tos for online shopping.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.asos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asos</a> is a browsers’ paradise with offerings for vintage lovers and label hunters alike. Another caveat (sorry!) is that some sellers won’t ship to certain countries, so <a href="https://marketplace.asos.com/help/faq?ctaref=mktp|footer|helpinfo|delivery#how-long-delivery-takes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’ll want to check that</a> with the seller beforehand. In some cases, they’ll make exceptions. This year, <a href="https://www.asos.com/discover/black-friday-cyber-monday-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Friday starts on November 25th</a>, so be sure to mark your calendars and have your credit cards ready. Asos recognizes that Canadians pay more in taxes for imported goods, so they <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/payment-promos-gift-voucher/why-are-you-offering-15-discount-to-canadian-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer a 15% discount</a>, year-round to Canadians. Sweet deal, eh?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/g34429509/best-black-friday-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Town &amp; Country has its own annual list</a> of the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, which they are updating daily. You can find deals on everything from homewares, to electronics, to jewelry, even wine! And if you’re worried about duties, remember that BorderBuddy agents are ready to help calculate your import fees if they do apply, so don’t let uncertainty hold you back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.overstock.com/spring-black-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overstock</a> is a one-stop shop for all Black Friday deals, and deals on overstocked goods from all over. Many major retailers have a large surplus of goods due to limited spending during the COVID pandemic, so even if Black Friday shopping isn’t usually your thing, you may want to give it a try this year.</p>
<h3>What are Canadians spending the most for Black Friday/Cyber Monday?</h3>
<p>Via <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2021/11/more-canadian-consumers-expected-to-shop-black-friday-cyber-monday-2021-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retail Insider</a>, Canadian BFCM shoppers main reasons for shopping online during BFCM are: want to take advantage of online sales (51 per cent), save time (46 per cent), get better prices online (45 per cent) and take advantage of free shipping (44 per cent); and</p>
<p>The <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2021/11/more-canadian-consumers-expected-to-shop-black-friday-cyber-monday-2021-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top categories Canadian Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a> shoppers plan to purchase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronics (47 per cent); Clothing/footwear/accessories (46 per cent);</li>
<li>Toys/games/hobby supplies (31 per cent);</li>
<li>The top category in terms of total spend is electronics (31 per cent).</li>
</ul>
<p>With shipping a pervasive concern, operating outside of duty and customs, buyers would be wise to read the fine print and see the total cost of their purchase before completing the sale. Although we can’t intervene with shipping costs, BorderBuddy is here to help with streamlining duty and customs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other than parking tickets, paying for shipping has to be one of the least enjoyable ways to part with your hard earned money. Between our <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free duty calculator</a> and our own <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BorderBuddy Shopify app</a>, we do what we can to avoid delivery shock and give you total visibility when shipping your packages across the border. However, recently, industry bigwigs like UPS and FedEx have revealed their own shipping schemas, touted to reduce the cost of shipping for those shipping orders large and small.</p>
<p>According to UPS, via <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/head-ups-unveils-all-in-pricing-without-delivery-surcharges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freightwaves</a>, “UPS (<a href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UPS/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE: UPS</a>) is marketing the initiative as a simplified way to pay for shipping and a convenience to shippers.” There is a catch (when isn’t there?) as upon closer inspection, these consolidated rates might look like discounts, but by doing away with individual import codes in favour of a blanketed approach, shippers may end up paying more shipping and duty on the same products.</p>
<p>Size matters here, but to the benefit of SME (small and medium enterprises) or hobby shippers. The new format will be available to all customers, regardless of the size of their average shipments (also known as their “shipping profile”). The new formula will be available to those shipping by air and ground, as well as internationally. No minimum volume commitment will be needed for small to midsize shippers (SMBs), who make up the bulk of our BorderBuddy clientele. The larger volume shippers will have a minimum volume commitment, but that is unlikely to affect you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bottom line, are streamlined, one-size-fits-all shipping rates good for me as a small importer/exporter?</strong></em></p>
<p>Consolidated shipping rates have existed for a long time, but only recently has a streamlined option been made available to smaller shippers. Time will tell if UPS’ streamlined rate makes much of a difference to you. It will also be interesting to observe whether other major shipping companies, like FedEx or Purolator, follow suit. We’ll keep watching and let you know. After all, our mission is to make the border disappear, while fattening up your bottom line and leaning down your shipping and duty rates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/lighting-up-the-bug-electrification-of-a-vintage-vw-beetle-an-intro-to-borderbuggy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last segment on BorderBuggy</a>, we shared the concept behind it: making a very vintage VW Beetle into an electric vehicle. If you’ve read any headline or talked about surging gas prices with anyone (who hasn’t…remember when $1 per litre seemed unseemly?), you know that they are hugely popular, and with good reason. Canada is working towards its commitment of being <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net-zero by 2050</a> and the USA is looking to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-pledges-end-gas-powered-federal-vehicle-purchases-by-2035-2021-12-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">year 2035 for stopping the sale of any gas (fossil) fuelled cars</a>. So &#8211; with electric vehicles on the rise, our CEO, Graham Robins is showing how it&#8217;s done. It’s not a coincidence that the car he’s chosen to electrify is a VW bug, as <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/volkswagen-electric-vehicles-germany-tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VW is leading the way globally</a>.</p>
<p>Progress is already underway on Graham’s BorderBuggy project, and today we’ll peel back a few layers of the EV onion on who he’s working with, and how, to assist him on this shockingly innovative endeavour.</p>
<h3>Kaotic Kustoms Ltd.</h3>
<p>Graham has chosen Langley, BC’s <a href="http://kaotickustoms.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaotic Kustoms Ltd</a>. to do the mechanical work on the project. They specialize in automotive fabrication, and have been in business since 1989. Kaotic Kustoms does everything from hydraulics, paint, suspension work, custom upholstery, restorations, tires and wheels &#8211; all completely customized to their client’s needs/desires. Kaotic has an almost unlimited supply of auto parts for every make, and if they don’t have them, they source them. Kaotic is essential in this project, and is definitely a trusted partner.</p>
<p>Graham’s history with the owners is long – he’s been friends with Jan Christensen, the principal of Kaotic, since elementary school. In our next segment, we’ll interview Jan and Graham about their process for undertaking BorderBuggy’s electrification.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harnessing the power of the sun sounds like something out of Greek mythology or the latest addition to the Marvel Universe. In fact, solar power, which is literally energy created by sunlight, has become a bright spot (&#8230;🥁) all over the world. Politicians, activists, scientists, the general public are all excited about the possibilities that better solar panels and better solar batteries will harken a future that is less carbon-heavy, greener, and even <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/productline/power-generation/solar-panels-noiseless-emissionless-power-generation/articleshow/69129662.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less noisy</a> than traditional energy sources.</p>
<p>Just what are solar panels? Via <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/productline/power-generation/solar-panels-noiseless-emissionless-power-generation/articleshow/69129662.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economic Times</a>:</p>
<p>“Solar Panels are the devices that act as a medium to trap the sun&#8217;s rays which are then converted into useful heat or electrical energy. They are also termed as photovoltaics or Solar PV as they consist of PV (solar) cells. It is a solar cell system where the PV cells are arranged in a grid-like pattern. It also comprises a semiconductor such as silicon.</p>
<p>Solar panels do not create any noise as they harness the energy of the sunlight to generate electricity and heat. They even act as a physical barrier to heat when placed on the roofs of homes and buildings, protecting against the elements, while generating power. There’s a reason for so many “sun worshippers” &#8211; it’s not just about the summer bronzing. Solar could play a role in a greener future, and BorderBuddy would *love* to help you bring solar panels across the border.</p>
<p>Speaking of borders, solar power is making huge inroads across the globe, notably in Canada and the USA, which is where BorderBuddy comes in. Panels were once prohibitively expensive, and their batteries maxed out at a certain storage. Now, a surge in solar growth is being fueled by falling prices, with the price of installation of solar dropping more than 60% over the past decade. According to US-based SEIA (Solar Energy Industries Association), the drop in prices for solar panels permitted the industry to expand into new markets while deploying thousands of systems.</p>
<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
<p>These are US costs, but are comparable across other nations:<br />
An average-sized residential system has dropped from a pre-incentive price of $40,000 in 2010 to roughly $20,000 today, while recent utility-scale prices range from $16/MWh &#8211; $35/MWh, competitive with all other forms of generation.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEIA</a>. Prices are falling &#8211; and buying in bulk decreases the cost per unit &#8211; ideal for importing/exporting.</p>
<h2>Why should I import/export solar?</h2>
<p>While solar panel exportation in <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/canada/international-trade-investment/1106354/challenges-facing-renewable-energy-developers-in-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada had fallen 83% due to tariffs</a> introduced by the USA, just recently, on <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/11/section-201-lifted-for-canada-made-solar-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 11th, 2022, President Biden dropped the tariffs imposed on Trump</a> &#8211; opening up the solar import/export industry to a much sunnier outlook for prospective importers and exporters in Canada and the USA.</p>
<p>Solar is an option that more and more families, companies and governments are seriously investing in as the world weans itself off of fossil fuels. They are relatively affordable, and within some years, can actually earn energy credits back instead of drawing energy from traditional grids. Most solar panels&#8217; efficiency lasts for at least 30 years, so they would need to pay for themselves in that amount of time even to be considered an investment. Thankfully, many systems have a payback period <strong>between 8 and 16 years,</strong> allowing them to <a href="https://ca.renogy.com/blog/what-is-the-average-solar-panels-roi-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double their payback period</a>.</p>
<h2>Where should I buy solar panels/equipment:</h2>
<p>Solar panels and their semiconductors are widely available online. However, there is a big buyer (importer/exporter) beware: because of the friction between China and the USA, pieces of solar equipment that were manufactured in China are unlikely to be accepted into either Canada or the USA. Elemex is a Canadian solar company with a wide range of solar panels, for personal purchase or for architects, developers and other buyers hungry to offer greener energy solutions. The appeal for sustainable, power-generating, even profit-earning solar panels is increasing, particularly as net-zero goals continue to be put forth by governments across North America. Volts is another reputable solar dealer, even offering free shipping, with some terms and conditions. Solar Electric Supply is based in the US, and has extensive solar power systems available for wholesale purchase.</p>
<h2>Forecast for solar: sunny sunny sunny ☀️☀️☀️</h2>
<p>It’s an interesting market, to say the least, with focus increasing on alternative energy sources, across the globe. Why not try your hand at being an early adopter? You may reap large benefits financially, while also feeling good about helping the planet.</p>
<p>Questions? Give us a call or chat with one of our BorderBuddy agents &#8211; they have the sunniest of dispositions &#8211; and all the answers you’d need in making the border disappear for importing and exporting solar equipment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems no matter where you go, or who you talk to, climate change is a much discussed issue with ample voices on each side. Some decry it as fear mongering, some take a more scientific approach and look at hard data. We’re not here to preach, but more to share some findings that are interesting and even, hopeful, about the future of shipping via water. Whether land, air or water, importing and exporting makes the world function, so today we’re taking a closer look at sustainability in shipping on water, and what that looks like.</p>
<p>Shipping is essential to the world, certainly if you’re an importer / exporter. More than 90% of all goods traded globally are transported by “some 90,000 marine vessels” via <a href="https://europe.oceana.org/en/shipping-pollution-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shipping Pollution | Oceana Europe</a>. However, the oceanic shipping industry has, like other modes of shipping, come under scrutiny due to the enhanced awareness and concern surrounding fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Via European NGO Oceana,</p>
<p>“Over 90 percent of world trade is carried across the world’s oceans by some 90,000 marine vessels. Like all modes of transportation that use fossil fuels, ships produce carbon dioxide emissions that significantly contribute to global <a href="http://eu.oceana.org/our-campaigns/stopping_climate_change/campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="http://eu.oceana.org/en/stopping-climate-change/acidification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acidification</a>. Besides carbon dioxide ships also release a handful of other pollutants that contribute to the problem.</p>
<p>The shipping industry is responsible for a significant proportion of the global climate change problem. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">More than three percent of global carbon dioxide emissions can be attributed to ocean-going ships.</span> This is an amount comparable to major carbon-emitting countries &#8212; and the industry continues to grow rapidly.</p>
<p>In fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions.”</span></p>
<h3>Shaping up oceanic shipping’s carbon footprint &#8211; before shipping out</h3>
<p>Our reliance on them for all modes of transportation is &#8211; <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/07/23/faster-cheaper-greener-are-drone-deliveries-the-future-of-logistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for now</a> &#8211; simply a reality. There is a reason to look more closely at water shipping, and also, there’s also reason to feel hopeful, as many advances have been made and are being made that lighten the carbon footprint of oceanic shipping. Circular shipping is being explored, as are greater processes for streamlining ship space to carry the most cargo per trip, decreasing unnecessary idling, which is wasted fuel. Ports are also working on <a href="https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/renewables/maritime-shipping-tries-to-reduce-emissions-but-key-obstacles-remain-in-its-lane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming much more efficient</a> with timing and use of space, which is crucial as regardless as the size of the ships being built, ports and waterways are largely immovable.</p>
<p>There is hope on the horizon for all modes of transport, which is good news for everyone, from import/exporters to everyday consumers. It’s an interesting time in importing and exporting, where a few blockages and/or weather events have shown us that we simply must get more conscious and creative when it comes to sustainable transport &#8211; and that certainly includes shipping by water.</p>
<p><strong>And we’ll all float on…okay? 🚢💦</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much do you know about the luxurious, svelte and sexy Jaguar? Its history is tres European. Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, Jaguar&#8217;s business was founded as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow_Sidecar_Company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swallow Sidecar Company</a> in 1922, originally making motorcycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sidecars</a> before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of S. S. Cars Limited, the business extended to complete cars made in association with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Motor_Company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Motor Co</a>, many bearing Jaguar as a model name. The company&#8217;s name was changed from S. S. Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Motor Corporation</a> followed in 1966,[3] the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Motor_Holdings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Motor Holdings</a> (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Leyland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Leyland</a>, itself to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalised" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalised</a> in 1975.</p>
