										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn’t love a good deal? Black Friday has turned into at least a week-long affair, with pre-Black Friday sales, “Cyber Monday”, “Cyber Monday Weekend”. Paying full price? Unheard of. Canadians are spending more on Black Friday sales every year, with 61% expected to spend.</p>
<h3>How to stay in the black for US Black Friday shopping</h3>
<p>However, there is a caveat to many of these massive sales, especially if you’re a Canadian who is shopping online for US bargains. Not unlike the good Superbowl Commercials, many coveted brands aren’t available in Canada. So, how do you get your hands on some serious bargains without getting unexpected, hefty duty fees? BorderBuddy is here to help, in a few key ways. Firstly, you can always use our <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free duty calculator</a>. If you can’t get an immediate quote, an agent will email you an estimation, free of charge, so you can make informed buying decisions. Secondly, we’ve gone ahead and done research for you on the brands with the best all-in prices for their online holiday sales. Here are some go-tos for online shopping.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.asos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asos</a> is a browsers’ paradise with offerings for vintage lovers and label hunters alike. Another caveat (sorry!) is that some sellers won’t ship to certain countries, so <a href="https://marketplace.asos.com/help/faq?ctaref=mktp|footer|helpinfo|delivery#how-long-delivery-takes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’ll want to check that</a> with the seller beforehand. In some cases, they’ll make exceptions. This year, <a href="https://www.asos.com/discover/black-friday-cyber-monday-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Friday starts on November 25th</a>, so be sure to mark your calendars and have your credit cards ready. Asos recognizes that Canadians pay more in taxes for imported goods, so they <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/payment-promos-gift-voucher/why-are-you-offering-15-discount-to-canadian-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer a 15% discount</a>, year-round to Canadians. Sweet deal, eh?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/g34429509/best-black-friday-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Town &amp; Country has its own annual list</a> of the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, which they are updating daily. You can find deals on everything from homewares, to electronics, to jewelry, even wine! And if you’re worried about duties, remember that BorderBuddy agents are ready to help calculate your import fees if they do apply, so don’t let uncertainty hold you back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.overstock.com/spring-black-friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overstock</a> is a one-stop shop for all Black Friday deals, and deals on overstocked goods from all over. Many major retailers have a large surplus of goods due to limited spending during the COVID pandemic, so even if Black Friday shopping isn’t usually your thing, you may want to give it a try this year.</p>
<h3>What are Canadians spending the most for Black Friday/Cyber Monday?</h3>
<p>Via <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2021/11/more-canadian-consumers-expected-to-shop-black-friday-cyber-monday-2021-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retail Insider</a>, Canadian BFCM shoppers main reasons for shopping online during BFCM are: want to take advantage of online sales (51 per cent), save time (46 per cent), get better prices online (45 per cent) and take advantage of free shipping (44 per cent); and</p>
<p>The <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2021/11/more-canadian-consumers-expected-to-shop-black-friday-cyber-monday-2021-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top categories Canadian Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a> shoppers plan to purchase are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronics (47 per cent); Clothing/footwear/accessories (46 per cent);</li>
<li>Toys/games/hobby supplies (31 per cent);</li>
<li>The top category in terms of total spend is electronics (31 per cent).</li>
</ul>
<p>With shipping a pervasive concern, operating outside of duty and customs, buyers would be wise to read the fine print and see the total cost of their purchase before completing the sale. Although we can’t intervene with shipping costs, BorderBuddy is here to help with streamlining duty and customs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other than parking tickets, paying for shipping has to be one of the least enjoyable ways to part with your hard earned money. Between our <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free duty calculator</a> and our own <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BorderBuddy Shopify app</a>, we do what we can to avoid delivery shock and give you total visibility when shipping your packages across the border. However, recently, industry bigwigs like UPS and FedEx have revealed their own shipping schemas, touted to reduce the cost of shipping for those shipping orders large and small.</p>
<p>According to UPS, via <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/head-ups-unveils-all-in-pricing-without-delivery-surcharges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freightwaves</a>, “UPS (<a href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UPS/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE: UPS</a>) is marketing the initiative as a simplified way to pay for shipping and a convenience to shippers.” There is a catch (when isn’t there?) as upon closer inspection, these consolidated rates might look like discounts, but by doing away with individual import codes in favour of a blanketed approach, shippers may end up paying more shipping and duty on the same products.</p>
<p>Size matters here, but to the benefit of SME (small and medium enterprises) or hobby shippers. The new format will be available to all customers, regardless of the size of their average shipments (also known as their “shipping profile”). The new formula will be available to those shipping by air and ground, as well as internationally. No minimum volume commitment will be needed for small to midsize shippers (SMBs), who make up the bulk of our BorderBuddy clientele. The larger volume shippers will have a minimum volume commitment, but that is unlikely to affect you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Bottom line, are streamlined, one-size-fits-all shipping rates good for me as a small importer/exporter?</strong></em></p>
<p>Consolidated shipping rates have existed for a long time, but only recently has a streamlined option been made available to smaller shippers. Time will tell if UPS’ streamlined rate makes much of a difference to you. It will also be interesting to observe whether other major shipping companies, like FedEx or Purolator, follow suit. We’ll keep watching and let you know. After all, our mission is to make the border disappear, while fattening up your bottom line and leaning down your shipping and duty rates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>BorderBuddy &#8211; Questions for Monty McCallum &#8211; Innovation Lead</h3>
<p>Have you ever used the BorderBuddy app? Even if you haven’t, anyone who appreciates innovation, especially when it comes to cutting down or eliminating costs and frustration, will appreciate this interview. Monty McCallum is the Innovation Lead at BorderBuddy and chief architect of the BorderBuddy app.</p>
<p>Monty walks us through the genesis of the app, and why it was designed to delight cross-border consumers, importers, and exporters.</p>
<p>Q: Without giving away trade secrets, what does the BorderBuddy app do?</p>
<p>A: Monty McCallum: Our Shipping to Canada app, provides instant shipping rates at the time of checkout for Canadian customers wishing to buy from a Shopify powered webstore, that ship from the USA. The shipping rates include all customs charges so customers don’t have any surprise fees at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Q: What can you tell me about the technology and how it works for users on the front end?</p>
<p>A: Monty McCallum:</p>
<ol>
<li>For merchants,
<ul>
<li>Go to the Shopify app store and download our app</li>
<li>Follow a few onboarding steps to sign up with BorderBuddy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For customers,
<ul>
<li>Go to the merchants website, place an item in your cart and go to checkout</li>
<li>The customer then adds an address with Canada as the country for the ‘ship to’ address</li>
<li>Choose from three shipping choices, see example <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AG0ovib7klxE87VMNKyQd_AfdGAi1merkAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>Pay for the order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After this is complete, BorderBuddy’s app charges the shipping amount to the merchant and sends them a shipping label and a commercial invoice to attach to the package. The merchant ships the package and the carrier scans the shipment when it takes possession. Our app then updates the order as fulfilled. Our app then sends the customs documents into our Customs business systems where our certified customs brokers will submit the declaration on behalf of the importer to CBSA. Shipment gets delivered and you have a happy customer.</p>
<p>Q: What did you want to achieve/what are/were the goals of the BorderBuddy app?</p>
<p>A: Monty McCallum:</p>
<p>We have many goals. We aim to stop carrier ransom where carriers will hold a package until they get paid for exorbitant customs brokerage fees and eliminate surprise charges for all Canadian ecommerce shoppers.</p>
<p>Q: How many iterations has it had? When was it created?</p>
<p>A: Monty McCallum: Hundreds with iterations deploying daily / It took 18 months to engineer and get registered on the Shopify network, and was deployed to production with our first merchant onboarded in August 2021.</p>
<p>Q: Why did you create new technology rather than relying on existing technologies?</p>
<p>A: Monty McCallum &#8211; Out of necessity! There is and was no existing technology to be able to do what we are doing, so we had to create it.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Monty for taking the time to explore and explain BorderBuddy’s powerful app technology. Of particular interest, he created it to “stop carrier ransom”! No one likes that, and similar benefits with the BorderBuddy customer in mind are part of why thousands of people are turning to BorderBuddy to make their cross-border importing seamless, painless, and free of unpleasant surprises.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an importer, it’s vital to stay up-to-date with the latest trade news so you can try to gauge the impacts on your business. In a post-pandemic trade climate, following trends could be more important than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although US imports, on the whole, are performing spectacularly compared to last year, there are 6 import categories that are down more than $1 billion from 2019. Each of these categories might reflect a change that has occurred due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that COVID-19 has had a </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/is-covid-19-still-affecting-importers-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serious impact on international trade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like everything else in the world). Countries are experiencing new product trends that can inform importers and exporters alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at these 6 imports that have dropped significantly can help you choose more lucrative imports in the future. If you are currently importing any of these products, you might want to think about adjusting your </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/a-sample-outline-for-your-import-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">import plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sell products that have more immediate growth potential.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. Passenger vehicles</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The category of passenger vehicles is down </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6.33 billion from 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This huge decline of 15.83% is mainly caused by the current </span><a href="https://abc7news.com/semiconductor-chips-chip-shortage-technology-cars/10869896/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer chip shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has led to a reduction in vehicle manufacturing. Other products affected by the shortage include appliances and consumer electronics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another possible cause of the drop in imported vehicles is the pandemic itself. Many people have been enjoying staying home more and not having a commute. The idea of buying a new car is not necessarily on their minds. Others have lost their jobs, meaning they can’t afford to purchase a new car at this time. It’s important to note that used cars are currently in high demand.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Oil</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil imports are down </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6.33 billion from 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well, with a decline of 15.83%. This drop has been steady in recent years, with 2021 oil imports down 62.17% from 2013. Of course, oil has not been as vital during the pandemic, but that’s only part of the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the US is leaning towards greater self-sufficiency and less imported oil. You might think this also reflects the trend of electric cars and sustainable fuel, but US oil consumption </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/petroleum-and-other-liquids/annual-refined-petroleum-products-consumption?pd=5&amp;p=0000001001vg0000000000000000000000000000000000g&amp;u=0&amp;f=A&amp;v=mapbubble&amp;a=-&amp;i=none&amp;vo=value&amp;&amp;t=C&amp;g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&amp;l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&amp;s=94694400000&amp;e=1577836800000"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to increase each year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For now, it appears this decrease in oil imports does not point to a decline in oil consumption.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Aircraft engines and parts</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which company is the leading exporter of the US? It’s Boeing. Because of the problems that the plane manufacturer has been facing over the last year, aircraft engines and parts are down </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.74 billion from 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s a shocking decline of 44.82%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of Boeing’s string of fatal crashes and the global pandemic that grounded most of the world’s planes for an entire year has led to this significant drop. Because Boeing has slowed its manufacturing significantly, it doesn’t need to import the same volume of aircraft engines it used to.</span></p>

<h3><b>4. Non-engine aircraft parts</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Boeing’s difficulties haven’t just affected engine imports. Non-engine aircraft parts have fallen </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.18 billion from 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a decline of 44.84%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you import anything tied to the airplane industry, you’ve probably been feeling the disastrous effects of Boeing’s downfall. Fortunately, United Airlines recently announced </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/united-airlines-unveils-270-jet-boeing-and-airbus-order-its-largest-ever.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an order of 200 Boeing Max jets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their post-Covid growth plan. That should boost aircraft-related imports in the next few months. </span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>5. Gasoline</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gasoline imports have dropped </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.59 billion since 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a decline of 8.59%. Although the fall isn’t as pronounced as that of imported oil, the reason for the decline in imported gasoline is probably the same. Again, the US is endeavoring to become more self-sufficient when it comes to oil and gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may not directly impact you as an importer since you probably don’t import gasoline. However, you can learn from this decline regarding the overall trends surrounding the automobile industry. Perhaps now isn’t the best time to be importing products in this category.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>6. Women’s apparel</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the imports on this list, this one is probably the most difficult to explain. The category of women’s apparel is down </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.02 billion from 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Surprisingly, the subcategory of women’s pants alone accounts for approximately 40% of this loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps women aren’t spending as much money as they used to on clothes. Another explanation is the </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-does-the-us-china-trade-war-affect-importers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US-China trade war</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has heavily impacted trade between the two countries. China went from being the top supplier of women’s pants to the US as recently as 2020 to losing its number one spot to Bangladesh this year. It’s possible that this supply chain disruption has caused fewer pants to be imported to the US.</span></p>
<h3><b>US imports that are soaring in 2021</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a break from the negative and focus on the positive. Which US imports are off the charts for 2021? What are some products you may want to consider importing in the future?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer imports are up </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/06/30/imports-are-flying-but-these-six-are-down-more-than-1-billion-each/?sh=472beb572285"><span style="font-weight: 400;">29.14% since 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and furniture imports are also up 25.17% since 2019. Other import growth trends include food, machinery, office equipment, pharmaceuticals, and textiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you thinking about starting your own import business or changing the products you currently import? Don’t forget to keep these things in mind when deciding which products to import in 2021. Keep an eye on trade news to catch any new trends that could benefit (or harm) your business.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importers have had a lot to consider lately. With the global pandemic, supply chain changes, safety considerations, and economic hardships, it’s a tough time to be in the import export business. All of these challenges have shifted concerns about the US-China trade war to the background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade war began in 2018 as a result of President Trump’s pledge to confront China’s manufacturing dominance and increase American jobs. He used heightened tariffs and other tactics in an attempt to force China to accept a number of demands, including enhancing intellectual property protections. China fought back with retaliatory tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the full ramifications of the US-China trade war remain to be seen, it’s clear that the economies of both countries have been influenced in significant ways. Of course, this leads to ordinary importers being enormously impacted by the trade war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re already an importer or you’re thinking about starting your own import business, it’s wise to consider how the trade war might affect your company. After all, no one knows when or if tariff rates will return to normal.</span></p>
<h3><b>Is the US-China trade war still happening?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though most people think of the trade war as a distinctly Trump-era phenomenon, President Biden has not yet ended the trade tension. The Biden administration is examining the phase one trade deal but has made no move to lower the tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tariffs remain about at their peak, with US tariffs on Chinese goods at 19.3% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 20.7%. These tariffs are </span><a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than they were before the trade war began in 2018, when they were 3.1% and 8.0% respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems as though </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/03/28/trade-war-biden-administration-not-ready-to-yank-china-tariffs-but-open-to-talks/?sh=e9709b05e8b7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Trade Representative Katherine Tai</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is open to trade negotiations but reluctant to suddenly reduce tariffs. She believes such a move could harm the US economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the US-China trade war is still happening, and it’s causing problems for both the US and China. Importers should be aware of its potential implications on the industry.</span></p>
<h3><b>The impact of the trade war</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While President Trump meant to cripple the Chinese economy while advancing US manufacturing, it seems that his goals were not realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of floundering under the heavy tariffs, China has increased trade with other nations, most notably the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has surpassed the US to become China’s largest trading partner. China has also expanded its trade to Europe and sub-Saharan Africa during the trade war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to an overall decline in imports from the US as well as other countries, China’s trade balance has improved significantly. Many Chinese companies are now looking to move their manufacturing to developing economies such as Mexico and India that can serve the US market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the United States economy has greatly suffered from the trade war. Since Chinese manufacturers didn’t lower their prices in response to the tariffs, the burden fell on US companies to pay for the trade war. Increased costs led to huge job losses and wage cuts for American workers. American farmers and manufacturers have also suffered from China’s retaliatory tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese exports to the US decreased by </span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/06/24/in-u.s.-china-trade-war-new-supply-chains-rattle-markets-pub-82145"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$87 billion from 2018 to 2019 alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has led the United States to look elsewhere for its cheap labor and manufacturing needs. The main beneficiaries of this have been Vietnam, Taiwan, and Mexico. Perhaps this is the reason why US manufacturing remained stagnant even with the tariff protections granted by President Trump.</span></p>

<h3><b>Navigating the trade war as an importer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you get too far into the political weeds of the trade war, it can be difficult to figure out exactly how it can affect you as an importer. Here are three keys to keep in mind to navigate the trade war.</span><b></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>1. Consider your supply chain</b><b></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you thinking about finding a supplier in China? Now may not be the ideal time for that. Although Chinese manufacturers are still some of the best equipped in the world to produce a wide variety of goods, manufacturers in several emerging markets could be rising up to take their place.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many American companies are looking to </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/tips-for-importing-and-or-exporting-to-southeast-asia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">find suppliers in Southeast Asia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don’t forget to check out which countries the US has a free trade agreement with so you can save on tariffs and speed up the customs process.</span><b></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>2. Take tariffs into account</b><b></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve already decided to rely on a Chinese supplier, don’t get blindsided by the hefty tariffs. Do plenty of research in advance so that you can allocate part of your budget to paying these tariffs.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared for changes as the international atmosphere continues to shift. China is still the top global manufacturer, but there are some up-and-coming markets that might give it a run for its money. At this point, China is still a suitable place for you to find imports, as long as you have the funds to cover the tariffs.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>3. Keep an eye on the news</b><b></b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire import-export world is waiting to see what will happen with the trade war. Not only are American and Chinese businesses impacted by the trade war, but other nations are being negatively or positively affected as well.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an importer, it’s extremely important for you to stay informed about international news so that you’re prepared for whatever comes. Keep your ears open and look for opportunities that could come your way with the shifting tides.</span></p>
