										<content:encoded><![CDATA[Love it or loathe it, winter is coming. With it comes many activities to seize snow days &#8211; like sledding through the backcountry on your wintry chariot. Or, as they are more commonly called, snowmobiles. Snowmobiles, sleds, Skidoos, all are powerful ways to enjoy pow, and what better time than the present to kit yourself up for when the snow starts accumulating?

We’ve rounded up some of the best snowmobile sites on the web. We also found a <a href="https://www.hardcoresledder.com/threads/importing-canadian-sled-into-us.1182505/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useful forum</a> for snowmobile fans to chat about their own experiences bringing sleds to and from Canada and the USA. In many ways, it’s <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-307?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar to importing a vehicle</a>, like a car or truck, but there are some key differences. We’ve compiled as much how-to and where-to info for you in this article, but when in doubt, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call or email us</a>. Depending on where you are in the world, we know the window for enjoying the white stuff on your snowmobile is precious &#8211; and may be limited! So, let’s go shopping.
<h3>Where to buy the best new and used sites for sleds, snowmobiles and Skidoos</h3>
<a href="https://www.snowmobiletrader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snowmobile Trader</a> has a huge selection of new and used snowmobiles, drawing in thousands of sellers and buyers looking for the best in snow adventure sports machines. Carrying such industry staples as Polaris, Yamaha, Arctic-Cat and others, Snowmobile Trader even lets you look for the sleds closest to you via zip/postal code. More than just a shopping site, it also has a handy review forum, blog and extensive community of passionate snowmobilers who share their insights into the best new and used options for every level of sledder.

<a href="https://www.sleddealers.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sled Dealers.ca</a> is a great place to find new and used snowmobiles, parts, gear, and has a highly functional search tool that lets you narrow down your search results really specifically if you know what you’re looking for, or lets you look more broadly if you don’t quite know what you want yet and are curious what’s out there. Sleddealers.ca boasts itself as being Canada’s #1 snowmobile dealer &#8211; and we can see why!

If you’re ready to make your selection, snowmobiles fall under the same category as a vehicle, so our BorderBuddy customs calculator will be very helpful for you. Check it out before you buy. Then, once you’re ready, make sure you follow our checklist for importing and exporting snowmobiles into the USA.
<h3>Snowmobiles import checklist: USA</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>You must submit all export documents at least 72 hours prior to export</li>
 	<li>File the Electronic Export Information (EEI) in the Automated</li>
 	<li>Export System (AES)</li>
 	<li>Content</li>
 	<li>Documents of title (ownership, new or used) are required for vehicles titled in the USA, ideally original versions but certified copies are also acceptable</li>
 	<li>Must provide two complete copies of the original Certificate of Title or certified copy of the original</li>
 	<li>Vehicle must be presented on the day of export at the appropriate port of entry, with complete documentation, examination and verification of the VIN</li>
</ul>
NOTE: many ports don’t process vehicles for export on weekends, so call ahead to avoid frustration of being turned away

For importing snowmobiles into Canada, the same rules apply as importing any other regulated vehicle. Check out our <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/importing-cars-from-us-to-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on importing vehicles with BorderBuddy into Canada</a>, and it should answer all your questions. Provided they meet the same safety and other requirements as a car/truck, you will simply pay the same customs rate. Use our <a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/is_purchased" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free customs calculator</a> to get an estimate. We’ll have you zooming through powder in no time!<p>The post <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/where-how-to-buy-snowmobiles-across-the-border-get-ready-to-shred-sled-heads/">Where &#038; how to buy snowmobiles across the border: get ready to shred, sled heads</a> appeared first on <a href="https://borderbuddy.com">BorderBuddy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may have heard that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) as we know it, is no more. NAFTA was a very big deal for a long time. Between 1993 and 2013, the total value of agricultural trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada grew <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2015/april/nafta-at-20-with-regional-trade-liberalization-complete-focus-shifts-to-other-methods-of-deepening-economic-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">233%</a> (<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/agricultural-trade-under-usmca-challenges-potential-solutions-and-win-win-opportunities#:~:text=The%20USMCA%2C%20however%2C%20isn',between%20the%20US%20and%20Mexico." target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounting for inflation</a>) from USD16.7 billion to USD82 billion.

In June 2020, NAFTA was done away with and replaced with the less catchy United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement#:~:text=The%20United%20States%2DMexico%2DCanada%20Agreement%20(USMCA)%20entered,farmers%2C%20ranchers%2C%20and%20businesses." target="_blank" rel="noopener">USMCA contains updated policies</a> and procedures necessary to ensure continued agricultural sector growth in all three countries. It is meant to be a mutually beneficial partnership and a win for North American farmers, ranchers and businesses. If utilized properly, the USMCA can not only solve some key lingering trade issues but also expand on the successes achieved under NAFTA. This trade agreement eliminates many common barriers to trade and enhances the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico by:
<ul>
 	<li>Creating a more level playing field for American workers, including improved rules of origin for automobiles, trucks, other products, and disciplines on currency manipulation.</li>
 	<li>Benefiting American farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses by modernizing and strengthening food and agriculture trade in North America.</li>
 	<li>Supporting a 21st Century economy through new protections for U.S. intellectual property, and ensuring opportunities for trade in U.S. services.</li>
 	<li>New chapters covering Digital Trade, Anti Corruption, and Good Regulatory Practices, as well as a chapter devoted to ensuring that Small and Medium Sized Enterprises benefit from the Agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does it mean for importing into the USA from Mexico?</h3>
What it means for day-to-day imports and exports is something of a work in progress/trial and error process, even 2 years in. The different political structures (and strife) with the USA and Mexico have meant that the processes and adoption have been slower and bumpier for importers on both sides of the US/Mexico border.
<h3>Mexican export laws &#8211; what has changed since NAFTA?</h3>
Agriculture producers stand to gain the most from USCMA, but consumers in the US also benefit with <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/agricultural-trade-under-usmca-challenges-potential-solutions-and-win-win-opportunities#:~:text=The%20USMCA%2C%20however%2C%20isn',between%20the%20US%20and%20Mexico." target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased access</a> to cheaper and higher quality fruits and vegetables The increase in availability and decrease in price of fruit and vegetables under NAFTA contributed to an 11% increase in total per capita consumption of vegetables in the US, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.

As an exporter from Mexico to the US, or, an importer into the US from Mexico, greater trade opportunities exist for food importing. The environment is a winner, no matter what country you’re from as the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46793#:~:text=USMCA%2520also%2520contains%2520several%2520mechanisms,facility%252Dspecific%2520rapid%2520response%2520mechanism.&amp;text=The%2520Environment%2520Chapter%2520instead%2520provides%2520for%2520two%2520cooperation%252Dbased%2520mechanisms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreement</a> requires each country to adopt, maintain and implement 7 multilateral environmental agreements and requires a customs verification mechanism between the U.S. and Mexico to combat the illegal trade of flora, fauna, fish and forestry items.
<h3>Cheaper import fees <a href="https://usacustomsclearance.com/process/importing-products-from-mexico-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(for the most part)</a></h3>
When it comes to imports from Mexico to the US, there are no import duties on nearly all products. Some products still have an import duty, but at a <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Mexico-Import-Tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced USCMA rate</a> that’s still lower than it would be when imported from other countries.
<h3>Faster turnaround</h3>
Typically, the closer the country you’re importing from, the quicker the turnaround times are for processing. Place of origin impacts the viability of trade partnerships, and regulations also vary accordingly. But, the geographical closeness of Mexico to the USA makes it a preferred trading partner. So, there are reasons to celebrate the new trade agreement!
<h3>Positive Perception by Consumers</h3>
Consumers have been comfortable with NAFTA for a long time, and have been largely pleased with the continued ease for Mexican exports, being imported into the USA. Consumers like to believe they are supporting both local and neighboring economies, so when goods are labeled (accurately) as “Made In North America”, consumer confidence is higher, no matter what acronym the trade agreement has.
<h3>Stable Trade Relations</h3>
While trade with countries like China and Russia are under intense domestic and international scrutiny and strain, Mexico’s continued net-positive relationship with the USA makes it a stable, <a href="https://usacustomsclearance.com/process/importing-products-from-mexico-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even preferred trade partner</a>. This makes importing from Mexico into the USA easier and more advantageous.
<h3>In Sum</h3>
Trade relations between the USA and Mexico are still strong, and while there are some finer details about agriculture, jobs and biotech, for the most part, trade into the USA from Mexico is still advantageous versus countries outside of the USCMA. If you have any questions, our BorderBuddy experts are ready and willing to help, so please <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out to us at any time</a>!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have some exciting news for our American BorderBuddy pals! BorderBuddy will soon be able to import cars INTO the USA. For years, you’ve been clamouring for us to help get your dream cars south of the border, from Canada to the USA, and it has not been for a lack of trying on our part that it has taken as long as it has.

Border regulations specific to the automotive industry made it really challenging from a legal standpoint, and only recently has our team felt confident that we’re overcoming these challenges to make it possible to please our customers on both sides of the border.
<h3>When will it happen!?</h3>
As soon as it’s a go, we’ll post on our social channels, share on our website, and update our blogs.
<h3>What does it mean?</h3>
It means that like our Canadian customers who have been enjoying our BorderBuddy (free!) import tax calculator on bringing cars into Canada from the USA, our American friends can use the same calculator to start their importing process. Whether you’re in Des Moines or Denver, if the car of your dreams is sitting on the other side of the 49th parallel, it can soon be in your driveway.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re reading this, you probably live and breathe paperwork, happily or unhappily. Importing and Exporting is a “cross the Ts, dot the Is” kind of business, and we’re in the business of making your business humming, streamlined and in compliance with both Canadian and American border services agencies.

Our BorderBuddy experts compiled this outline with the tips and questions they most frequently get &#8211; and if we’re missing anything, <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">please let us know</a>!

One form that you may have encountered, particularly if your organization is in the business of trade shows, is the <a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/e29b-eng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E29B form</a>. The E29B form or Temporary Import Bond/Temporary Admission Permit is frequently held by importers needing to retain goods in Canada temporarily, and under specific circumstances. This form allows brands to showcase their goods at multiple trade shows while minimizing the cost when goods are returned across the border.

If the request type qualifies, and certain conditions are met and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the goods are eligible for full or partial tax and duty relief</span>, a refundable deposit is put down to hold that relief/refund.

There are <a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/e29b-eng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many restrictions</a> as to what items qualify, and how much GST/HST refunding is owed. Our team knows these inside and out and will work with you to iron out any details. Many of our customers would prefer to brief our brokers on their specific needs and wants, and our brokers work to deliver a set of solutions that makes it turnkey for our clients.

<strong>Here are some key considerations to keep in mind for E29B/Temporary Admission Permit use cases:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>An E29B is valid for a specified time-frame (18 months subject to extension approval from the CBSA). It is dependent on the provisions within the varying Regulations.</li>
 	<li>Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit may constitute an offense under the Customs Act, thereby rendering the goods liable to seizure and forfeiture.</li>
 	<li>The goods imported must be presented to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) for identification at the time of re-exportation, and the permit copies must be provided for acquittal (closure)
<ul>
 	<li>Goods must return in the same condition as exported, without having been increased in value or improved in condition by a manufacturing process or other means.
<ul>
 	<li>Failure to comply with these terms and conditions may result in the forfeiture of the deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>If you can’t export the goods within the <strong>specified time period</strong>, or have any questions, contact the nearest CBSA office <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEFORE</span> the expiry date</strong> on this permit. You can also give us a call &#8211; TOLL FREE (866) 926-0674, our BorderBuddy agents know the intricacies of this process in and out, so don’t waste time if you’re in a time crunch or feeling panicked!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>E29Bs are controlled items while in Canada, disposal or sale of products is prohibited without Customs&#8217; authorization. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They must be re-exported under CBSA supervision on or before the expiry date of the permit.</strong></span> On re-exportation, both goods and permits must be presented for identification and comparison.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Failure to surrender this temporary admission permit upon leaving Canada and providing BorderBuddy with a stamped copy <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will forfeit your deposit</strong></span>. No one wants that!
<h2>How much does it cost to start an E29B?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To <strong>open</strong> an E29B is $350.00
<ul>
 	<li>This involves getting all the documentation prepared, classification of your goods, obtaining origin declarations if needed, tallying up the duties and/or taxes, and ultimately finalizing the documentation so you don&#8217;t have any headaches at the time of crossing!</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>To <strong>close</strong> an E29B is $150.00
<ul>
 	<li>This involves ensuring the permit has been closed with CBSA in the appropriate manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plan ahead &#8211; when you can.</h2>
It’s in your best interest to provide BorderBuddy with a minimum of 2 business days lead time so we can comprehensively work on your request, given the processing time that is required.

In a pinch, we can work with rush shipments, but it could be <strong>subject to a $150.000 rush fee</strong> for processing.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Lineage Fee</strong>: First 10 lines are included, anything over that amount is $2.00 <strong>per line</strong>.</li>
 	<li>BorderBuddy will require a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>deposit</strong></span> which is equal to any duties and/or taxes that would be owing on the products; Which is fully refundable upon <span style="text-decoration: underline;">closure of the E29B</span> (that is, when <strong>all</strong> goods are re-exported back out of Canada, and a copy of the stamped permit is provided to us indicating that this has occurred.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Still want to proceed? Here’s what we need:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Provide BorderBuddy with an invoice (or letter) for customs&#8217; purposes indicating:
<ul>
 	<li>When are the goods due to cross the border, and where?</li>
 	<li>Expected time items are remaining in Canada</li>
 	<li>Products&#8217; use in Canada
<ul>
 	<li>Examples: Trade Shows, Competitions, Concerts, etc.</li>
 	<li>When you want to bring goods into Canada for a trade show or exhibition, the event must be recognized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). You must also be a registered exhibitor for the event. This proof usually comes in the form of a letter of recognition, which you may have to provide to CBSA to import your exhibition items. Contact the event organizer (as ahead of time as possible!) for a letter of recognition, which will help facilitate the smooth movement of your goods through customs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Description of the products being imported;
<ul>
 	<li>Serial/ID numbers of each item (if applicable, i.e. electronics)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Value per item
<ul>
 	<li>Including currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Quantity per item
<ul>
 	<li>NMB, KGM, LBS, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Country of Origin per item
<ul>
 	<li>This is the original place of manufacture</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Delivery destination address in Canada along with contact information
<ul>
 	<li>This will be the location where the goods are destined within Canada</li>
 	<li>Examples may include: Arenas, stadiums, offices, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Departure address along with contact information
<ul>
 	<li>This will be the location where the goods are leaving from</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Packing lists, Bills of Lading, etc.</li>
 	<li>Are your goods crossing with a commercial carrier? If so, we need a copy of that carrier’s documentation.</li>
</ol>
NOTE: There are some different requirements based on the ultimate &#8216;use&#8217; in Canada. Our team will advise promptly if any additional information is required! When in doubt, <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give us a call</a>! Our BorderBuddy agents are ready and excited to help you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[You have a discerning eye and a passion for the classic, unique and even exotic, when it comes to vehicles. You are always browsing, whether in person (made possible again, yay travel!) or online. There’s no shortage of ways to fall in love with your next roadster, sites like Shiftgate, and Barret-Jackson have our buying trigger finger tempted every time we peruse their auctions. Whether you’re a classic collector or a statement starter (hello: Mecum auctions lets you bid on racecars?!), the challenge isn’t finding the unique vehicles of your dreams, it’s getting those beauties to you, wherever you are.

For many, the mere thought of the logistics involved with paperwork, transport, taxation and all the other matters associated with making large, cross border, complex purchases is enough to dissuade them from fulfilling their auto ownership dreams. At BorderBuddy, we’re dream makers.

<strong>Don’t just take our word for it, in the words of Stacy Puckett Taylor, Vice President of Car Culture at Shiftgate:</strong>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“We&#8217;ve had a longstanding partnership with BorderBuddy that allows us to focus on finding the best cars from all over the world and importing and exporting them to 1000s of car lovers per year. They know the ins and outs of importing luxury cars and our clients have been incredibly satisfied working with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
How? We shift you out of the “many dreams left unfulfilled” bucket and into one comprised of the increasing number of delighted auto enthusiasts who are using BorderBuddy to get their dream cars into their garages! It’s remarkably simple, once you work with a trusted BorderBuddy expert, who like you, dreams in chrome. We have established relationships with auto auctions, border services, and various shipping/carrier transports. Together with our BorderBuddy technology and industry-leading processes and protocols, we make the purchase and shipment of your classic, unique, cross-border vehicle a breeze.
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
e-Commerce has changed the game when it comes to buying most things, unique cars are one of the markets that have really flourished with the freedom of online browsing, listing and buying. Barrett-Jackson and Shiftgate, for example, boast hundreds of vehicles you won’t find at your local auto dealer, catering to discerning auto aficionados, all over the world. The fun part remains, you browse, barter and buy your vehicle. BorderBuddy will assist you in quickly clearing customs in 4 simple steps:

</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[If ever there has been a time for a global “reset” button, now would be the time. However, as anyone involved in shipping knows, there is no such thing. Not even a “pause” button, sadly. We can offer you the next best thing, which is an ongoing high level navigation guide to the ever changing circumstances affecting global trade, with a focus on importing and exporting.

At a 30,000 foot view, we see the ongoing crisis in Ukraine causing gas prices to skyrocket and inflation rates to creep upwards as uncertainty continues. Russia’s chokehold on surrounding nations with natural gas and oil is causing ripple effects on the global economy, most certainly affecting prices for shipping anything across any borders. For reference, Russia produces about 11% of the world’s oil. Our BorderBuddy agents are closely monitoring headlines and industry chatter, and are as always, committed to finding you the best routes and methodologies for your importing and exporting, no matter the size of your business.

<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2813 alignnone" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-10-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-10-1.jpeg 1000w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-10-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/border-buddy-img-10-1-768x511.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />

According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61235528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC</a>, oil prices are expected to stay elevated into 2024, which will lead to widespread inflation. Disruptions from the war are expected to have a lasting negative effect, with sanctions on foreign companies and reduced technology creating snarls across the world.
<h3>China: lockdowns and uncertainty</h3>
<a href="https://time.com/6168543/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://time.com/6168543/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact/</a>

Simultaneously, China is in partial lockdown courtesy of its aggressive COVID-Zero policy, which is shaking the already fragile global supply chain. According to economics and trade policy professor, Eswar Prasad of Cornell University and former head of the IMF’s China Division, “The already extensive <a href="https://time.com/6168543/china-zero-covid-shanghai-lockdown-economy-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruptions to global supply chains are being exacerbated</a> by the lockdowns in China, adding to inflationary pressures and difficulties in procuring a broad range of consumer goods.” The restrictions put into place as part of COVID-Zero amplify ongoing supply disruptions by affecting the country’s industrial production and export activity. Simply put by a top Hauwei executive, China’s COVID-zero policy might trigger “massive losses&#8221; and directly impact the global supply chain.

Via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-export-growth-beats-expectations-imports-slip-2022-04-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, China&#8217;s imports unexpectedly fell in March due to the COVID-19 restrictions across large parts of the country. The lockdowns delayed the arrival of freight shipments while domestic demand shrunk, and overall export growth slowed down. Analysts anticipate a worsening in trade in the second fiscal quarter.
<h3>What does this mean to me?</h3>
On a macro level, the world is in a state of much upheaval and uncertainty. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, and we get it. Our BorderBuddy agents are people just like you, witnessing the same disruptions. The difference between our BorderBuddy team and you is that it is our job to consider the impact and implications of all of these factors as we go about ensuring you have the best importing and exporting experiences possible. We are always monitoring borders and are agile in our approaches to finding you the best solutions.

If it means changing how you usually import or export, our agents are there alongside you, discussing and helping determine what makes the most sense for your bottom line. There’s only so much that you can control, and working with BorderBuddy is one of the surest ways to keep your business running smoothly and your communication and insight into your shipments transparent, managed, and streamlined.

Feel like a chat? Give us a ring, we’re a short call away.<p>The post <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/navigating-importing-exporting-during-a-confluence-of-chao/">Navigating importing/exporting during a confluence of chaos: from China, to COVID to Ukraine</a> appeared first on <a href="https://borderbuddy.com">BorderBuddy</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing a plane into the United States is not like importing other vehicles. There are strict rules and procedures to follow and typically, the process must happen in a certain order to avoid excess taxes and penalties.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need to know if you want to purchase and import a foreign plane into the US? </span>
<h3><b>Start with a purchase and sale agreement</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you purchase a foreign plane and bring it to the US, it’s wise to have a purchase and sale agreement in place. This agreement states exactly how you will buy the plane, how it will move across US borders, and which party is responsible for each part of the transaction and import process. Without a purchase and sale agreement, you and the seller have no recourse if a dispute arises.</span>
<h3><b>Required forms and information for airplane importation</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing a plane into the US requires certain forms you must submit to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). You’ll need to gather some important information about your airplane to fill out these forms and create your purchase and sale agreement:</span>

<h3><b>Getting an airworthiness certificate</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the airplane importation process is getting an airworthiness certificate. The aircraft must meet FAA standards before it can be registered and used in the US. Airworthiness should be determined by a designated airworthiness representative (DAR).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re purchasing a foreign aircraft, it’s typical to set up a pre-buy inspection that takes place in the US. The DAR may not declare the aircraft airworthy and let you know what work needs to be done to make it airworthy in the US. Costs of repairs to the plane to make it acceptable for FAA standards fall to the buyer. For this reason, it’s important to have this inspection before the purchase of the aircraft is final. To make the pre-buy inspection possible, the seller will also have to follow CBP regulations to get the aircraft into the US.</span>
<h3><b>Registering an imported aircraft with the FAA</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another component of importing a plane into the US is registering the aircraft. To be registered with the FAA, the plane must be deregistered in its country of origin. The FAA requires:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statement from the foreign country’s national aircraft registry indicating that registration has ended</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence of ownership, such as a bill of sale signed in ink</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A completed </span><a href="https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/185220"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aircraft Registration Application AC Form 8050-1</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A check or money order payable to the Federal Aviation Administration for $5 (USD)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can send your registration information to the FAA by mail and should write “Import” in red ink on the envelope.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Deregistering your aircraft from a foreign country could be more complex than you think. In the US, tracing the ownership of an airplane is relatively straightforward because the FAA is the only agency you need to check to verify an aircraft’s records. Any title company one-time can easily search FAA records for claims impacting the title.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada, on the other hand, does not have a federal agency for aviation. Tracking an aircraft’s chain of ownership requires checking with several regional and provincial agencies. If you’re buying a plane from Canada, deregistration may take a while. It’s important to understand the deregistration process of the country you’re purchasing your aircraft from, as it could impact the importation timeline.</span>

<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2347" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-tim-gouw-5800210-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<h3><b>Do you need title insurance?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Title insurance covers your financial loss and any related legal expenses should there be a dispute with the title of your airplane. It’s a one-time premium paid at the closing of the sale. Should there be a problem with tracking down the chain of ownership of your plane, or if it’s discovered there’s a lien against it, you could incur serious financial losses. Compared to the financial hit you’d take from a defective title, the cost of title insurance is worth it.</span>
<h3><b>Working with a customs broker</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the process of importing a plane into the US relies on several things happening at the right time. You can’t complete the purchase until the plane is inspected. But it’s better to have it inspected in the US by a US mechanic. But then, the seller must contend with customs to get the plane to the US which can quickly lead to headaches.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By working with a </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hiring-a-customs-broker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certified customs broker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can make the import process much more streamlined.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[A guide on importing a boat into the US, from the experts in exports.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The US has thousands of lakes, bays, and shorelines to go boating on. Heading into the country with your boat to enjoy these areas can seem like a no-brainer. But if you purchased your boat outside of the US, you will have to deal with customs and you may even have to pay import duties.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re bringing a foreign boat into the US, what tips do you need to keep in mind?</span>

<a class="primary-btn" href="/contact/">WE CAN HELP</a>
<h2><b>Importing a Boat Into the US for Personal Use</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To import a boat for personal use into the US, you must have two documents with you, including:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof of ownership (such as a bill of sale)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof the boat conforms to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To prove your boat meets EPA standards, you must have </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/importing-vehicles-and-engines/epa-standard-form-3520-21-importation-engines-vehicles-and-equipment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engine Declaration Form 3520-21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/importing-vehicles-and-engines/importing-canadian-vehicles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">importing your boat from Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and you purchased it from a Canadian manufacturer) the boat’s emissions standards are probably similar to the standards required by the EPA. However, unless your vehicle has an EPA emissions compliance label, you will have to fill out the Engine Declaration Form. Alternatively, you may get a letter of compliance from the US representative of the boat’s manufacturer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are importing jet skis into the US, you must also fill out </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/importing-vehicles-and-engines/epa-standard-form-3520-21-importation-engines-vehicles-and-equipment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engine Declaration Form 3520-21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><b>How much is the import duty on a boat?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most pleasure boats are subject to import duty when imported into the US. According to </span><a href="https://cbpcomplaints.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1184?language=en_US"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customs and Border Protection (CBP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current duty rates that apply to boats are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailboats and motorboats other than outboard motorboats: 1.5%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outboard motorboats: 1%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflatable vessels: 2.4%</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canoes: no duty</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowboats/other vessels not designed for use with motors or sails: 2.7%</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tariff rates on imported goods are always subject to change. You can find the most recent import duty percentages on boats in the </span><a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/1001c89.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), Chapter 89</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To help you calculate import duties on your boat, you can also speak with a certified customs broker.</span>

<h3><b>Are there other taxes levied on boats?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only US federal tax you will have to pay for importing your boat is one of the tariff rates listed above. Sales tax and GST/HST/PST only apply with the purchase of the boat. If you buy a boat in Canada, you’ll have to pay the applicable GST. When you cross the border to the US, you do not also have to pay US sales tax. Keep in mind, however, that some US states do levy a personal property tax on boats. If you purchase a boat in the US, you will pay the sales tax of the state you bought it in (there is no federal US sales tax, it’s only at the state level).</span>

<h3><b>Importing a boat on a trailer</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are carrying your boat across the border on a boat trailer, you will need a 17-character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for the trailer, as it’s considered a “motor vehicle.” You must also fill out </span><a href="http://icsw.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/hs799short.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOT FORM HS-7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the US Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You will need to know the make, model, and year of your boat trailer to fill out this form.</span>
<h3><b>Import procedures for arriving by boat</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pleasure boats (non-commercial vessels) </span><a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-67?language=en_US"><span style="font-weight: 400;">must report their entry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the US upon arrival in any port or place within the US if the following is true:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a vessel from a foreign port or place</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a foreign vessel from a port of place within the US</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a vessel of the US carrying foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In these situations, the master of the vessel must immediately report arrival to the nearest CBP facility. You can report by telephone, using the CBP ROAM app, or in person at the nearest Port of Entry. If CBP refers you for formal entry, you must complete and provide </span><a href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/forms/form-1300-vessel-entrance-or-clearance-statement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 1300</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 48 hours.</span>
<h3><b>Buying a US boat to use in the US if you are not a US citizen</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you travel to the US to purchase a boat and you are not a US citizen, as soon as the sale is complete your boat is considered an unregistered vessel. To move the boat out of the jurisdiction of the port it’s currently in, you must file <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/forms/form-1300-vessel-entrance-or-clearance-statement">Form 1300</a> with CBP. </span>
<h3><b>Cruising licenses for foreign vessels</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have a foreign-flagged vessel, such as a Canadian boat, but often cruise through US waters. No vessel can cruise through US waters without documentation, whether it’s US-flagged or foreign-flagged. Most US states require owners to register their boats, but what about foreign vessels that sail into US waters for short periods of time?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid having to pay an import duty at every port and to move from port to port freely, you can get a CBP Cruising License. They are available from the CBP Port Director at the first port of arrival in the US. The CBP Cruising License is valid for one year. With the license, you still have to file a Notice of Arrival (NOA) with the National Vessel Movement Center (NMVC) with the US Coast Guard, however. Note that this cruising license is only available for non-commercial small vessels and pleasure boats.</span>

<h3><b>Purchasing a Canadian boat to bring back to the US</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you purchase a Canadian-registered boat in Canada and want to import it into the US, you will have to de-register it through Transport Canada so you can register it with the US state you plan to use it in. You must purchase the Canadian boat in Canada, then pay a duty on it at the US border. It’s not possible for the seller to move a Canadian boat to the US so you can purchase it in the US because it is illegal to sell a foreign vessel in the US.</span>
<h2><b>Does importing a boat into the US sound like a hassle?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing a boat to the US can be complex. Whatever your situation — a non-US citizen bringing a boat across the border to use, a US citizen purchasing a foreign boat and bringing it back to the US, or a foreign vessel sailing in US waters — BorderBuddy can help you understand your customs clearance obligations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want to get in trouble with CBP, and you don’t want to face steep fines for violating customs regulations, so let a certified customs broker handle the import for you. </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call BorderBuddy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to see what we can do for you.</span>
