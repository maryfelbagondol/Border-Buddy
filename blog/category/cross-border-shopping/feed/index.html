										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to expand your Shopify business to the 35 million Canadians who could potentially become new customers? It may seem straightforward, but it can actually be much more complicated than shipping to your American customers due to complicated Canada customs fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy’s new Shopify </span><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/canadacustomsduty" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Customs Duty App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to focus on selling your products without having to worry about customs clearance. It’s the perfect solution for easily shipping your products across the border.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hassle-free shipments to your Canadian customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Canadian customers are looking to buy something from a US merchant, they want to know exactly how much they will need to pay in import fees. If your Shopify site doesn’t specify this amount, your customers may decide not to purchase your products due to fear of surprise fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy’s Canada Customs Duty App eliminates the mystery by including the exact amount of required import fees at checkout. When your Canadian customers reach the shipping part of the checkout process, they will see the duties included in the shipping cost. This will give them confidence that they won’t have to pay surprise fees when their package is delivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the cost to your business? Downloading the Canada Customs Duty App is completely free. You will only be charged when a Canadian customer makes an order. The customs brokerage flat rate is just $15.00 per order. That’s a 68% discount!</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2595" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-1024x576.png" alt="" width="702" height="395" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage.png 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-300x169.png 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-768x432.png 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<h3><b>The benefits of using the Canada Customs Duty App</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to exporting, the Canada Customs Duty App streamlines the process for you and makes it just as easy as shipping domestically. If you have lots of experience exporting but get easily frustrated by the confusing regulations surrounding customs fees, this app will relieve that customs stress so you can focus on selling to your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is enter your product information into the app, including the exact weight of the product. BorderBuddy will calculate the duty rate, which you’ll then be able to approve before it goes live to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a Canadian customer makes an order, BorderBuddy will automatically email you a DDP (Duty Delivered Paid) shipping label and a customs commercial invoice that you can attach to the package. The duties, shipping, and brokerage charges paid by the customer will be sent to your Shopify merchant payments account and will then be collected by BorderBuddy directly from your account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only be responsible for packing up the order, attaching the shipping label and invoice, and handing the package off to the carrier. Once the package has been picked up by the carrier, BorderBuddy will take care of declaring the shipment to Canada Customs so that it can cross the border safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your customers, it couldn’t be more simple. Instead of their packages being held ransom by the delivery truck until they pay unexpected customs fees, your customers will receive their packages quickly and without surprise costs. This positive experience will make them much more eager to order from you again in the future.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2596" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-1024x576.png" alt="" width="702" height="395" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted.png 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-300x169.png 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-768x432.png 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<h3><b>Canada Customs Duty App reviews</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that have tried our Canada Customs Duty App are extremely satisfied with their experience. They have been able to seamlessly expand their business to Canadian customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cheftog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHEFtog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Chicago-based company that specializes in premium-quality aprons. They’ve been looking for a simple way to reach Canadian customers without taking the leap of becoming a full import export business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s their review of the Canada Customs Duty App: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic app &amp; support is outstanding! Solved our biggest issue &#8211; shipping to Canada. When customers check out, they now see shipping + duties. No duty surprises once they receive their item. Integration was easy. How does it work? After a customer places an order, BorderBuddy sends you a shipping label and commercial invoice. Print and go. That&#8217;s it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get an edge over your competitors when it comes to the Canadian market, this app is exactly what you need. As an early adapter, you’ll be able to reach Canadian customers easily while other companies face additional obstacles when exporting to Canada.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of our customers are curious about the legalities, legwork, costs and paperwork of shipping electronics, like iPhones to and from Canada/the USA. Both countries have long-standing free trade agreements, formerly NAFTA, now USCMA which generally make cross-border shipping easier and cheaper.</p>
<p>Electronics are shipped across borders all the time, sometimes the deals are just better or certain devices are more readily available in one country than the other. However, as electronics tend to carry higher price tags than say, t-shirts, this means their details and declared value in shipping documentation needs to reflect that. Because of USCMA, products with a value of less than $150 CDN are free of duty. No duties or taxes will be applied if the total parcel value is below certain thresholds. For example, the Gift value threshold is $200.</p>
<p>This is called the “duty-free threshold”. Via the CBSA (Canadian Border Services Agency), the duty rules are as follows:</p>
<h3>Duty and tax exemptions on goods</h3>
<p>For a shipment imported by mail, the following still applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 and under: duty and tax free when imported from any country</li>
<li>Above $20: duties and taxes apply when imported from any<br />
country, including the US and Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p>For a shipment imported by courier (most of our BorderBuddy clients)</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported from any country (other than the US and Mexico)
<ul>
<li>Up to $20: duty and tax free</li>
<li>Above $20: duties and taxes apply, excluding the US and Mexico</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Imported from the US and Mexico
<ul>
<li>Up to $40: duty and tax free</li>
<li>Above $40 to $150: duty free, but taxes still apply</li>
<li>Above $150: duties and taxes apply</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus &#8211; most electronics will not qualify for the duty-free threshold, and will need crystal clear descriptions in their (lading bill? Import doc?). Their value &#8211; which will increase the cost of importing/exporting will be higher, but it’s important to be honest, in case your shipment gets lost or damaged in transport.</p>
<p>Via the <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/214/~/filing-a-formal-entry-(for-goods-valued-at-$2500-or-more)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Customs Border Protection (CBP)</a>, If you are sending a gift to the US then declare the item as an unsolicited gift on the invoice, along with its complete description and value. Make sure to send your gift to a residential address and not a US business address, otherwise, you will have to pay duties and taxes. The Formal Clearance threshold is $2,500. This means that if your shipment is worth over $2,500, it will be subject to delays as it goes through <a href="https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/214/~/filing-a-formal-entry-(for-goods-valued-at-$2500-or-more)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formal clearance</a>.</p>
<h3>Electronics &#8211; it pays to be precise</h3>
<p>The import of electronics is governed by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC). When sending electronics to America, the FCC requires an <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form740/740.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional form</a> for customs clearance. This must be completed by the sender and confirms that the electronics being sent abide by the FCC standards of import. The form should be completed and attached with the customs invoice for the parcel. <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BorderBuddy agents are here</a> to help every step of the way, and we find that especially with sending costly electronics, our customers appreciate having a human agent walk them through the process.</p>
<h3>Packaging &amp; labeling your electronics for shipping</h3>
<p>Electronics tend to be fragile, and costly. Packaging them securely to mitigate humidity and sudden movements is important. This is a handy checklist for secure packaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customs Invoice for your shipment. This document will determine how much tax and duties you will need to pay – so ensure it is completed properly and clearly.</li>
<li>Accurately describe each item included in the package. Include relevant details – for example, if it’s a mobile phone, say the make and model.</li>
<li>Remove as many parts of the device as possible and place them in a secure (like Ziploc) bag</li>
<li>Wrap the main body into several layers of bubble wrap and use tape to secure it</li>
<li>Fill the shipping box with packing material and place the wrapped component inside. For environmentally-conscious packing, you could try balled up old newsprint instead of styrofoam.</li>
<li>Put the smaller parts of the device you wrapped earlier and use foam or buffering filler to keep them from touching one another and sliding around.</li>
<li>Tape the box using heavy-duty tape</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="https://www.jetworldwide.com/blog/shipping-to-canada-from-the-usa-customs-carrier-fees-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all electronics (and packages) destined for Canada, customs entry forms must be made</a>. For express and postal shipments, a “Customs Entry Preparation Fee” must be paid, included and documented. The same applies for parcels shipped by ground to the USA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’re building your import export business, you’re probably looking for the perfect place to ship your products. In the course of searching for customers </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/keeping-it-continental-a-breakdown-of-shipping-by-continent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continent by continent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might have become curious about whether or not you can ship to Antarctica.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is yes, you can ship to Antarctica. Unfortunately, you are prohibited from shipping items to Antarctica for resale. There goes your dream of starting a company that exports hot sauce to the White Continent. Honestly, there aren’t many potential customers there anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the question: why would someone even want to send a package to Antarctica? Would it be to help out the penguins?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, there are many people who live in Antarctica, even more than the population of Alma, Wisconsin! About 4,000 people live in Antarctica, depending on the season. If you decide to send a package to one of them, expect it to take a while.</span></p>
<h3><b>Who actually lives in Antarctica?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of Antarctica’s inhabitants are scientists, researchers, and military personnel sent by various countries. 32 countries currently have research stations in Antarctica: Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the UK, the US, and Uruguay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antarctica offers a unique climate that interests researchers for many reasons. It has the cleanest air in the world, which is useful for providing neutral datasets. It also has minimal background radiation, which is helpful for experiments. Of course, many researchers work to protect its incredible biodiversity as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US has two main research stations in Antarctica: McMurdo Station (1,200 residents) and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (200 residents). If you dream of living in Antarctica, you can try to get a job on one of these bases. Perhaps you’ll end up working at the Burger King on McMurdo! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be surprised to find out that researchers aren’t the only ones who live in Antarctica. There is a Chilean settlement on King George Island in Antarctica that is home to about 200 people. They have a school, bank, gym, chapel, and even decent phone service. Of course, residents face many challenges there such as the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables and&#8230;the cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving to Villa Las Estrellas is a big decision for families, particularly because they are required to get their appendixes removed before moving there. This is due to the limited medical care in the town. People are also encouraged not to get pregnant while living there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to visit Villa Las Estrellas and see what life is like there, you can join the group of tourists that typically comes during the summer months. You won’t want to miss the opportunity to send a postcard from the small post office there–marked with an Antarctic stamp!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2545" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/penguins-g40bf35103_1280-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/penguins-g40bf35103_1280-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/penguins-g40bf35103_1280-300x225.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/penguins-g40bf35103_1280-768x576.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/penguins-g40bf35103_1280-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><b>How to ship to Antarctica</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you have a friend or family member who lives on one of the bases in Antarctica&#8230;or maybe you’re planning on moving there yourself. You might be curious how you can send a care package or extra belongings to the icy continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each research station has different requirements for sending packages. Make sure you check the delivery timeline. Sometimes people send packages to Antarctica for the summer only to have them arrive after they’ve already returned home in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a rule of thumb, you probably don’t need to ship anything to someone who’s only there for the summer. Packages simply take too long to get there. Instead, find a different way to show you care such as writing notes and hiding them in your loved one’s suitcase before they go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to send a package to someone who’s living in Antarctica for a longer period of time, you’ll need to check the deadline for sending it. There aren’t many vessels that come to Antarctica in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because Antarctica does not fall under any particular country’s jurisdiction does not mean you can send whatever you want. Every package that goes to one of the US’s research stations will pass through Christchurch, New Zealand, and undergo customs inspection there.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International trade can be complicated, especially when countries have their own sets of tariffs or import duties. When you import goods from abroad, you have to classify them a certain way, typically using a code. Learning how to use Harmonized System (HS) codes, </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/harmonized-tariff-code-get-hs-tariff-codes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harmonized Tariff Schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (HTS) codes, and Schedule B codes may seem daunting to new importers. But using these codes properly is vital for importing your goods legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the difference between HS codes, HTS codes, and Schedule B codes? When would you use each one, and what happens if you don’t get the code right?</span></p>
<h3><b>HS codes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HS codes come from the international Harmonized System, administered by the World Customs Organization (WCO). These codes classify all goods for international trade and are a universal standard around the world. 180 countries currently use the Harmonized System. The codes consist of six digits that identify the categories of the goods. These six digits denote the chapter, heading, and subheading of the good you’re importing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most countries have their own Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS), which are up to 10 digits instead of 6. HS codes are universal but HTS codes are specific to individual countries. For any documentation that you use internationally, i.e. in more than one country, you would use an HS code instead of an HTS code.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2534" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-1024x603.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="353" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-300x177.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-768x452.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-1536x904.jpg 1536w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-163726-2048x1206.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><b>HTS codes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the US and Canada have their own systems of tariff codes. In the US, it’s the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). In Canada, it’s the system of Canadian Customs Tariffs. Countries use HTS codes to assess duties on incoming goods. Importers label their shipments with codes so that border authorities can charge the proper amount of tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, HTS codes are 10-digit numbers that incorporate universal HS codes and add supplemental digits for US-specific classifications. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) administers HTS codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) keeps track of tariff codes, and both importers and exporters must use codes. Importers use a 10-digit import classification and exporters use an 8-digit one.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why you need both HS codes and HTS codes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you import something into another country, you need both the HS code and HTS code specific to that country. If you want to import something from France into the US, for example, you can’t use France’s tariff classification code because the US border authorities won’t accept it. You would need to use the HTSUS code for your French goods if you want to ship them to the US.</span></p>
<h3><b>Example of HTS codes</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2535 size-full" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sch-B-Code-Diagram.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="400" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sch-B-Code-Diagram.jpg 550w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sch-B-Code-Diagram-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This image shows an HTSUS code for horses. The first 6 digits consist of the HS code, showing that the horse belongs to the Live Animals chapter, falls under the heading of live horses, asses, mules, and hinnies, and under the subheading of purebred breeding horses. You would use these 6 digits for this type of import into any country that uses HS codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 4 digits are specific to the US. In this example, there’s no distinction for the imported horse or horses, so the statistical classification is “0000.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Schedule B Codes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, the Customs Tariff system applies to importers and exporters, requiring them to use different types of codes. In the US, exporters use Schedule B codes, which are based on the HTSUS codes. Schedule B codes help monitor US exports and the US Census Bureau administers them, rather than the ITC. With a Schedule B number, the first 6 digits are the HS code, but the last 4 digits differ from the HTSUS code or the digits used for importing the goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exporters use Schedule B codes when sending goods outside the US, as an HTSUS code cannot be used for exporting. You also cannot use a Schedule B number in place of an HTSUS code for importing.</span></p>
<h3><b>What happens when you get your import and export codes wrong</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classifying your imports or exports incorrectly is considered fraud. Border authorities will charge you fines and impose penalties that will make importing and exporting more difficult in the future. Because they use tariff codes to determine how much duty you should pay for importing your goods, using the wrong code may make it seem like you’re trying to pay lower duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBSA and US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) take classifying imported and exported goods seriously, so you can’t afford any mistakes. </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hiring-a-customs-broker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a customs broker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensures you have the right codes.</span></p>

<h3><b>How do you find HS codes, HTS codes, and Schedule B codes?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTSUS codes: To find the proper code for importing goods into the US, you can use the </span><a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ITC website</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canadian Customs Tariff codes: You can find Canada’s </span><a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/2021/menu-eng.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 tariff codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the CBSA website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule B codes: The US Census Bureau website has a </span><a href="https://uscensus.prod.3ceonline.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Schedule B codes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although all these codes are available online, knowing exactly which one to use can be tricky. Speaking with a certified customs broker can help you determine the code you need.</span></p>
<h3><b>Working with a customs broker</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does importing jargon confuse you? Do you struggle to know which codes to classify your goods with? Don’t risk making an error and paying penalties.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to expand your Shopify business to the 35 million Canadians who could potentially become new customers? It may seem straightforward, but it can actually be much more complicated than shipping to your American customers due to complicated Canada customs fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy’s new Shopify </span><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/canadacustomsduty" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Customs Duty App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to focus on selling your products without having to worry about customs clearance. It’s the perfect solution for easily shipping your products across the border.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hassle-free shipments to your Canadian customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Canadian customers are looking to buy something from a US merchant, they want to know exactly how much they will need to pay in import fees. If your Shopify site doesn’t specify this amount, your customers may decide not to purchase your products due to fear of surprise fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BorderBuddy’s Canada Customs Duty App eliminates the mystery by including the exact amount of required import fees at checkout. When your Canadian customers reach the shipping part of the checkout process, they will see the duties included in the shipping cost. This will give them confidence that they won’t have to pay surprise fees when their package is delivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the cost to your business? Downloading the Canada Customs Duty App is completely free. You will only be charged when a Canadian customer makes an order. The customs brokerage flat rate is just $15.00 per order. That’s a 68% discount!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2595" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-1024x576.png" alt="" width="702" height="395" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage.png 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-300x169.png 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-768x432.png 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usstage-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<h3><b>The benefits of using the Canada Customs Duty App</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to exporting, the Canada Customs Duty App streamlines the process for you and makes it just as easy as shipping domestically. If you have lots of experience exporting but get easily frustrated by the confusing regulations surrounding customs fees, this app will relieve that customs stress so you can focus on selling to your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is enter your product information into the app, including the exact weight of the product. BorderBuddy will calculate the duty rate, which you’ll then be able to approve before it goes live to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a Canadian customer makes an order, BorderBuddy will automatically email you a DDP (Duty Delivered Paid) shipping label and a customs commercial invoice that you can attach to the package. The duties, shipping, and brokerage charges paid by the customer will be sent to your Shopify merchant payments account and will then be collected by BorderBuddy directly from your account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only be responsible for packing up the order, attaching the shipping label and invoice, and handing the package off to the carrier. Once the package has been picked up by the carrier, BorderBuddy will take care of declaring the shipment to Canada Customs so that it can cross the border safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your customers, it couldn’t be more simple. Instead of their packages being held ransom by the delivery truck until they pay unexpected customs fees, your customers will receive their packages quickly and without surprise costs. This positive experience will make them much more eager to order from you again in the future.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2596" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-1024x576.png" alt="" width="702" height="395" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted.png 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-300x169.png 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-768x432.png 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gettingstarted-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning on shipping a package internationally? Whether it’s a huge package full of goods you’re planning on selling commercially or a small gift for your great aunt, you’ll probably want to consider the shipping rate changes that have occurred in 2021. After all, you wouldn’t want to be caught off guard at the post office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think of national couriers like USPS and Canada Post as being primarily for domestic shipping. On the contrary, many people choose to use either USPS or Canada Post for international shipping because of their reliability and affordable prices. Of course, international shipping rates tend to be higher than domestic rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For import export business owners, going with one of these companies is a great choice because of their tracking options and professionalism. Both USPS and Canada Post even offer a special discount for commercial packages. They have ways to help you with customs clearance as well.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why did shipping rates change?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to blame everything on the Pandemic, but that’s only one of the contributing factors to the shipping rate changes. In fact, COVID-19 is not even mentioned in either USPS’s or Canada Post’s explanation for the changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason shipping rates have changed is due to the huge decline in mail volume that has occurred over the last decade. This trend is expected to continue, with an estimated </span><a href="https://faq.usps.com/s/article/2021-Postage-Price-Changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">36% decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the year 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of this decline probably doesn’t come as a surprise to you. After all, people are accustomed to using technology to send documents and information they previously had to send by mail. With more and more communication platforms available and almost universal internet access, the return to relying on mail is probably not going to happen any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, this is likely only the first of many price increases to come in the next several years. As an importer or exporter, you’ll want to keep a close eye on shipping rates so you don’t get blindsided by future changes.</span></p>
<h3><b>USPS Shipping Rates 2021</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to choosing which USPS service to use for your package, there is an almost overwhelming number of options. The fastest international shipping option with tracking is called Global Express Guaranteed. It starts at $67.80 for a 0.5 lb package going to Canada. This service takes only 1-3 business days, with overnight delivery often possible to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many importers and exporters choose the Priority Mail International Flat Rate option with tracking, which takes 6-10 business days but tends to be much more affordable. You don’t have to pay more to ship heavier items, as long as they fit in the flat rate box and the total weight is under the specified amount. Small flat rate boxes (under 4 lbs) start at $29.55 for shipping to Canada, while large flat rate boxes (under 20 lbs) start at $71.05.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you’re wondering how these prices were affected by the rate change that happened at the beginning of 2021, they increased by about 3%.

<h3><b>Canada Post Shipping Rates 2021</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quickest way to send a package from Canada to the US is by using Canada Post’s Priority Worldwide option. This allows your package to reach its destination by 10:30 AM the following day in most cases. It also gives you the ability to track your package and automatically charges the recipient for taxes and duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more economical way to send your package is by choosing the Expedited Parcel option. It should take about 4-7 business days for your package to arrive. This option also includes tracking and hassle-free customs clearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices vary depending on package weight and destination. It’s easy to price out different shipping options using </span><a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/information/app/far/business/findARate?execution=e1s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Post’s rate comparison tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember that Canada Post offers various </span><a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/business.page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discounts and solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small and large businesses.</span></p>
<h3><b>Customs clearance assistance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that whenever you send a package to another country, it’s considered exporting. That means relevant duties and taxes will apply. Fortunately, duties typically don’t apply to packages sent between the US and Canada due to the </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/how-to-use-cusma-to-your-advantage/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, your packages will still be required to clear customs. This involves filling out customs forms and making tax payments. Taxes will typically be paid by the recipient of the package. If your package is detained by customs, you will usually be notified by your postal courier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering how much you’ll owe in duties and taxes for the package you’re importing? Get an estimate using our free </span><a href="https://app.borderbuddy.com/calculator2/public/import?_ga=2.244278726.250477810.1629728610-178661728.1610552693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customs fees calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using USPS to send your package, you can access customs forms and other customs clearance information on their </span><a href="https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Customs-Forms-The-Basics#sending_outbound"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re using Canada Post, the best option for commercial customs clearance is </span><a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/business/shipping/international/compare/priority-worldwide.page?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priority Worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes this service at no extra cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the resources offered by these postal couriers, customs clearance can be a challenge. Knowing which forms you need to submit and which taxes you need to pay can be overwhelming, especially if you’re new to the import export world. That’s where we come in. At BorderBuddy, we have over 10 years of experience helping people like you with commercial and personal customs clearance.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a big trade show coming up in Toronto and think it’ll be a great opportunity to market your products. But your business is based in the US, so any goods you take with you into Canada — even your exhibition materials — must be declared at customs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing items for trade shows or exhibitions is specific because generally, you only need to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> import your goods. To declare items for temporary import, you must follow certain customs procedures for both the US and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, you’ll learn the basics of importing exhibition items and some tips for moving your goods across the border more easily.</span></p>
<h3><b>Types of entries for trade show goods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your trade show goods can enter the US or Canada from abroad in a few ways. The type of entry you choose will depend on the value of your goods and what you’re using them for. Your entry options are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Consumption entry (US)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A consumption entry is for goods that are consumable, and usually best for anything less than $100 (USD) in value.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>B3 entry (Canada)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A consumption entry to bring trade show goods into Canada uses a B3 form. It covers souvenirs and advertising materials intended for sale or consumption in Canada, as well as branded paraphernalia left in Canada.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/temporary-importation-under-bond-duty-free-entry-goods-be-re-exported"><b>Temporary Importation Bond</b></a><b> (US)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the value of your imported goods is higher, then you’re usually better off with a temporary importation bond (TIB). A TIB entry allows you to import goods that are not for sale, for a set amount of time.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>E29B Temporary Admission Permit (Canada)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The </span><a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/e29b-eng.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E29B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Canada’s version of a TIB. It allows you to bring goods into Canada for a specified period. You use an E29B form instead of a B3 form if you are returning your branded paraphernalia, office machines/equipment, or display goods after you leave Canada.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>ATA Carnet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: An </span><a href="https://iccwbo.org/resources-for-business/ata-carnet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATA Carnet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an international customs document that allows you to import goods duty-free for up to one year. They’re used worldwide and recognized by both Canada and the US. You can get an ATA Carnet for your trade show goods from your local Chamber of Commerce.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hiring-a-customs-broker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customs broker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to tell which type of entry is best suited to your specific trade show items.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2520" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-300x225.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-768x576.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-energepiccom-313691-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><b>Importing for trade shows: Letter of recognition</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you want to bring goods into Canada for a trade show or exhibition, the event must be recognized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). You must also be a registered exhibitor for the event. This proof usually comes in the form of a letter of recognition, which you may have to provide to CBSA to import your exhibition items. Contact the event organizer for a letter of recognition to help facilitate the movement of your goods through customs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Are your trade show items duty-free?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When importing any item from abroad to Canada or the US, there’s always a possibility of </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/duties-tariffs-and-taxes-the-fees-of-importing-exporting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paying duties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on it, even for a trade show or exhibition. The only exceptions for trade show items are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the item is recognized in a letter of recognition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the item is imported under a TIB</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the item is eligible for duty-free import under a </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free trade agreement</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t have to pay duties on your trade show goods, note that you will have to pay a</span><a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-334?language=en_US"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merchandise processing fee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (MPF) to US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) for any imports not covered under a free trade agreement. This fee applies to all formal and informal entries and is an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ad valorem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fee or percentage of the value of the merchandise. As of 2020, this fee is 0.3464 percent. The minimum you will pay is $27.23 (USD) and the maximum is $528.33 (USD).</span></p>
<h3><b>Is your item restricted?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to checking if your item is subject to import duty, you must also check if there are certain </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/when-shipping-turns-illegal-things-you-are-not-allowed-to-ship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If importing into the US, you may need a license or permit to import one of the following items for trade shows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alcoholic beverages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/the-basics-of-importing-exporting-live-animals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and animal products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmaceuticals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firearms and ammunition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat and meat products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milk, dairy, and cheese products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants and plant products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poultry and poultry products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petroleum and petroleum products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegetables</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also face restrictions on trademarked or copyrighted goods, particularly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultural property</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazardous/toxic/flammable materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household appliances</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some electronics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toys and children’s articles</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think your trade show item might be restricted, it’s best to check with the relevant US agency to determine if you need a permit or license. Canada has similar import restrictions, so you should keep these limits in mind if you’re heading to a trade show in Canada as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customs broker can help guide you through this process and advise you on which products might require more paperwork than others.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2521" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-300x200.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-768x512.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-oleg-magni-2058147-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><b>Required documents for importing trade show goods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because importing always requires paperwork, you should expect to bring or have certain documents with you when you travel to the US or Canada for an exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These documents include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letter of recognition</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial invoice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work permit (if you plan to sell and deliver goods to the general public)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customs broker can help you gather the documents you need for importing your trade show goods, and verify that you’ve filled them out correctly.</span></p>
<h3><b>Preparing a commercial invoice for your trade show items at customs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you bring items across the border for an exhibition, you will need a commercial invoice. When creating your invoice, keep these tips in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List every single item you bring with you and be as specific as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine the correct value of each item. For gifts, list a value of 0.01 cents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describe the purpose of each item and the materials it’s made from.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register with appropriate government agencies for restricted items.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your commercial invoice should be accurate if you want to pass through customs without any holdups. An experienced customs broker can help ensure your commercial invoice is adequately prepared.</span></p>
<h3><b>Helping you move items across the border for trade shows</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot of planning to import items from abroad for a trade show.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of plants cross the border between the US and Canada every year. Whether you’re curating an eclectic garden in your backyard or running a profitable exotic plant business, the importing and exporting of plants, seeds and flowers is a booming industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals purchasing for personal use may find exotic plants in Thailand, Vietnam, or South America they can’t find at home. According to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/style/tropical-plants-rare.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are people obsessed with plants turning up with moving trucks at plant shows like Miami’s annual International Aroid Society Show and Sale. Not to mention, folks bidding for plants on eBay for up to $2,700 (USD)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurseries and plant shops may find that to compete, it helps to have a more exciting variety of merchandise, including plants from overseas or just across the border. For these business owners, importing plants and seeds may also prove to be more economical than growing their own on location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what the purpose, when importing or exporting plants in Canada or the US, you must know what government parties are involved to be sure you are complying with all regulations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Importing plants to the US</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When importing plants from foreign countries, make sure they meet entry requirements as stated by </span><a href="https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-600?language=en_US"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customs and Border Protection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Entry requirements will vary depending on the type of plant, but the following criteria universally apply: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you bring back/import 12 or fewer plants with no special restrictions, you do not need a permit. Special restrictions may include requirements such as a permit, post-entry quarantine, treatment, or ESA or </span><a href="https://cites.org/eng/disc/what.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) documentation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate from the country of origin showing that the plants meet entry requirements for the United States.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants should be bare rooted (no growing media attached to the roots).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should perform a basic visual inspection of plants. Look for insects or sickly-looking plant parts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrap plants in damp newspaper or similar material to prevent them from drying out. Roots may be secured in a plastic bag. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve or fewer plants are inspected by CBP at the first port of entry. Thirteen or more plants will be inspected by </span><a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APHIS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> personnel at the nearest Plant Inspection Station. If the officer finds plant pests that could cause harm to other plants, or if the plants do not meet entry requirements, they will be refused entry. This means you must forfeit the plants, which will either be destroyed or returned to the country of origin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelers are advised to consult with their nearest APHIS PPQ Plant Inspection Station to determine the admissibility of propagative plant material (including live plants, bulbs, corms, cuttings, root crowns, seeds, etc.).</span></p>

<h3><b>Importing plants into Canada</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the country’s national plant protection organization, and it regulates how plants enter and leave the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do is to find out if the plant you want to import is on the CFIA’s </span><a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/plant-health/horticulture/imports/horticulture-plant-list/eng/1419017863407/1419017907742"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horticulture Plant List</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a list of plants considered low-risk that may be imported as long as you meet basic requirements. According to </span><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/02/12/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-import-or-export-rare-plants-in-canada.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toronto Star</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some of the internet’s hottest plants — monsteras, philodendrons and anthuriums — are allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is the country’s national plant protection organization, and it regulates how plants enter and leave the country. The Star spoke with Patricia McAllister, a national manager with the CFIA, to see what people need to do to ensure their plants make it to Canada safely. </span></p>
<h3><b>What are the basic requirements?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as in the States, an import permit is needed. You need to get one from the CFIA through its </span><a href="https://inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/my-cfia/eng/1482204298243/1482204318353"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online portal, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the plant’s seller needs to make sure there is a phytosanitary certificate from the country of export. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All plant movement is essentially regulated under the International Plant Protection Convention,” McAllister says. “Essentially, the goal is if you have a pest, keep it; if you don’t have a pest, don’t let anyone send it to you. It really is about preventing the movement of pests between countries with plant material.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a phytosanitary certificate? It is a plant passport. It shows who grew the plant, where it is traveling to, where it originated from, confirming that the plant meets Canada’s requirements. Only a National Plant Protection Organization can issue a phytosanitary certificate. (In Canada, the CFIA issues these certificates for people who are exporting plants to other countries. If you’re planning to export a plant, contact your local CFIA office for next steps.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens if my plant doesn’t have this paperwork? Your plant could be destroyed or returned to its country of origin. If you’re buying from an international seller, it’s wise to confirm they are sending a phytosanitary certificate from their country with your plant. An import permit from the CFIA must be issued </span><a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/plant-health/plant-pests-invasive-species/plant-import/before-you-apply-for-a-permit/eng/1343414402266/1343414628852"><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your plant leaves its country of origin. </span></p>
<h3>What about endangered plants?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endangered plants are managed through Environment Canada. Certain plants have, as mentioned earlier, </span><a href="https://cites.org/eng/disc/species.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restrictions and need to have special documentation in addition to the other paperwork. Monstera is not on the </span><a href="https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/species.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITES list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although certain types of orchids are.</span></p>
<h3>What about bringing plants into Canada from the continental United States?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re driving into Canada from the US with your plants, the Canadian government has a personal exemption that allows you to bring up to 50 houseplants without paperwork as long as they are for personal use. The</span><a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/plant-health/plant-pests-invasive-species/directives/imports/d-08-04/appendix-7/eng/1324619570286/1324620215710"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> list of eligible plants </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is on the CFIA website. Generally, tropical and semi-tropical plants that can’t survive outside in Canada, and have thus been deemed low-risk, are exempt.</span></p>
<h3>What happens if my plant doesn’t have this paperwork?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your plant could be destroyed or returned to its country of origin. If you’re buying from an international seller, it’s wise to confirm they are sending a phytosanitary certificate from their country with your plant. An import permit from the CFIA must be issued </span><a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/plant-health/plant-pests-invasive-species/plant-import/before-you-apply-for-a-permit/eng/1343414402266/1343414628852"><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your plant leaves its country of origin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you live in the US or Canada, if you’ve ever considered importing plants from another country, there are definitely some hoops to jump through to ensure you don’t run into delays and other issues.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping between Canada, the US, and Mexico already has its challenges, but what if your business is ready to expand beyond North America? You’ll have many of the same import and export concerns, but there are several shipping considerations to take into account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at 6 things to consider related to the factors that impact your shipments leaving North America.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Create an export plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you ship internationally, your business should have an </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/7-tips-for-establishing-your-export-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">export plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In your plan, you should include the following:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Export potential</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Do your products have the potential to do well outside your home country? If your products turn a profit at home, they can likely do so in other countries with similar market conditions. But cultures are different. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Market research</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Is your target destination country a good market for your products? Does your home country have a </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/important-trade-agreements-to-be-aware-of/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free trade agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FTA) with the country you are selling to?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Export licenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses in the US rarely need an export license but Canadian companies must get a Business Number (BN) for importing and exporting. Also, check the list of restricted or prohibited imports for the country you’re shipping to. Trying to ship restricted items could be a costly mistake.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Understand the language barrier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since English is a recognized international shipping language, you typically won’t have to fill out a customs declaration in another language. For marketing your products to a foreign country, however, take the language barrier into account.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Helpful resources for your export plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Post has a helpful </span><a href="https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/tools/pg/manual/pgIntDest-e.asp?letter=A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lets you see import restrictions and rules to every country or territory you can ship to from Canada. UPS has a similar tool, called </span><a href="https://wwwapps.ups.com/tradeability/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeAbility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lets you estimate the costs of shipping from any country in the world to another, find harmonized tariff codes, and detect export licenses. Working with a certified </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customs broker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also make the customs clearance process go more smoothly when you ship your products outside North America.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2352" src="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-300x169.jpg 300w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-768x432.jpg 768w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://borderbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anugrah-lohiya-723240-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Choose between air freight and ocean freight</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shipping outside North America, you’ll have to use air freight or ocean freight to move your goods. Both have advantages and disadvantages which you should consider carefully before choosing one or the other.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shipping by air is faster than by sea</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the size of your shipment, air delivery could take between 3-9 days from Canada or the US to Europe. Sending shipments by air to China from North America takes between 6-13 days. Sea freight, on the other hand, takes much longer. Shipping by sea can take up to 30 days from North America to Europe and 45 days or more to Asia.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shipping by sea is cheaper than by air</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air delivery may be faster but it’s more expensive. Prices vary depending on the shipping service you choose and how much you’re sending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to decide which option is better for your business: air freight or ocean freight. Do you have the budget for the more expensive air shipping option or can you afford longer shipping times?</span></p>
<h3><strong>Allow longer delivery times</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which method of shipment you choose, your delivery times will always be longer when shipping outside North America. This may seem obvious, but many businesses forget to factor long delivery times into their export plan. How much longer can your customers realistically expect to wait?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending between the US and Canada may take anywhere from 1 business day to 2 weeks, depending on what you’re shipping and how much you pay. When shipping outside North America, your delivery times could range from 3 business days to six weeks or more. Your shipping service can give you a more accurate estimate and remember, the faster the delivery the higher the cost.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Avoid shipping scams</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/5-scams-to-avoid-when-expanding-to-international-shipping/">Scams</a> happen all the time in international shipping and the less careful you are the more likely it is you’ll encounter one. When you’re expanding your business into shipping overseas, look out for the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake freight companies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraudulent returns of products by customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping to fake international addresses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counterfeit customs fee notices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only providing a Bill of Lading (BOL) if you pay a fee</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Get shipping insurance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any time you import or export goods, you should have </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/a-breakdown-of-international-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shipping insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you ship outside North America, your shipment is en route longer and there are more chances of damage along the way. Shipping insurance will help you recover losses you incur if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a fire or a storm</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goods happen to damage someone else’s goods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your goods get stolen before they arrive at their destination</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees get injured while transporting your goods</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You never know what could go wrong with your international shipments, so it’s always smart to get good shipping insurance. Read our <a href="https://borderbuddy.com/blog/the-keys-to-effectively-insuring-your-imports-exports/">guide</a> on how to insure your imports and exports effectively to learn more.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Hire a customs broker to help you expand your business</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customs clearance can be one of the most complicated parts of the export process. It’s also where you’re most likely to make mistakes. A licensed customs broker like </span><b>BorderBuddy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can handle your customs declarations, ensure your paperwork is correct, and help you get the proper export license. If you want to expand your business to international shipping, </span><a href="https://borderbuddy.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to see what we can do for you.</span></p>
